If it is a tab character, all following statements in the if statement need to start with a tab character. Since these whitespaces are not visible, it is very easy to make mistakes and get annoying errors from the interpreter. To avoid this, we strongly recommend you to choose a style of indentation (e.g. 4 whitespaces or a single tab) and stick to it as a programming style.\n",

Somewhere in the process, without waiting for the terminating condition to become `False` in a while statement or exhausting all items in the iterator in a `for` statement, you decide to terminate looping. The `break` statement does exactly serve this purpose: The `while` (or `for`) is stopped immediately and the execution continues with the statement after the `while` (or `for`). \n",
