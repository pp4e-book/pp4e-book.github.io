        "## 6.1 Why define functions?\n",
        "\n",
        "There are four main reasons for using functions while developing solutions with a programming language:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. ***Reusability*** \n",
        "\n",
        " A function is defined at a single point in a program but it can be called from several different points. Assume you need to calculate the run-length encoding of a string (the example code from the previous chapter) in your program for $n$ different strings in different positions of your code. In a programming language without functions, you would have to copy-paste that code piece in $n$ different places. Thanks to functions, we can place the code piece in a function once (named `encodeRunLen` for example) and use it in $n$ places via simple function calls like `enc = encodeRunLen(inpstr)`. \n",
        "\n",
        " If functions would not be present, even if we would have the piece of code that does the actions of the function, how would we return to the different calling points after the actions are completed? Something, that is theoretically possible but extremely  painful. \n",
        "\n",
        "2. ***Maintenance***\n",
        "\n",
        "  Using functions makes it easier to make updates to the algorithm. Let us explain this with the run-length encoding example: Assume that we found a bug in our calculation or we have discovered a better algorithm than the one we are using. Without functions, you would need to go through all your code, find the locations where your run-length encoding algorithm is implemented, and update each and every one of them. This is impractical and very tedious. With functions, it is sufficient if you just change the function that implements the run-length encoding.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. ***Structuredness*** \n",
        "\n",
        " Let us have a look at a perfectly valid Python expression:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "(b if b<c else c) if (a if a<b else b)<(b if b<c else c) else (a if a<b else b)\n",
        "```\n",
        "which certainly takes some time to parse and understand but it just performs the following:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "max(min(a,b), min(b,c))\n",
        "```\n",
        "Assume instead of the long expression above, the one with `min` and `max` are used. Even if the definition of `max` and `min` are not given yet, still one can grasp what the expression is up to. It is not only because the expression is smaller, but  because function naming can depict the meaning for the actions.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. ***Benefits of the functional programming paradigm*** \n",
        "\n",
        " If a programmer sticks to the functional paradigm, then he or she has to plot a functional decomposition so that the solution of the problem is obtained by means of functional composition, something that is well-known and understood through Mathematics. This type of a solution does not suffer from unexpected side effects or variable alterations; therefore, testing and debugging are easier. Another benefit of the functional paradigm is recursion: In other words, while defining a function, we can call the function that is being defined -- we will cover this seemingly confusing concept below. Moreover, we can define higher-order functions that take functions as input and apply them to a sequence of data. All these benefits come free with using functions, as we will illustrate below.\n",
        "\n",
        "Even when we do not limit ourselves to ‘functional programming’, it is essential to use functions in professional programming. General algorithms that are coded as functions are becoming very valuable because they can be reused again and again in new programs. Collections formed by such general purpose functions are called *libraries*. For almost all application areas libraries have been created over decades."

        "\n",
        "The $\\color{red}{Statement}$, which can be replaced by multiple statements like we did with other compound statements, can make use of the $\\color{red}{Parameter_i}$s to obtain the actual arguments sent to the function at call-time. If the function is going to give a value in return to the call, this value is provided by a `return` statement. \n",

        "\n",
        "Here is a straightforward example. Let us assume that we want to implement the following function:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "F_{gravity}(m_1,m_2,r) = G\\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}.\n",

        "The following is the one-line Python code that defines it:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def F_gravity(m_1, m_2, r): return G * m_1 * m_2 / (r * r)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "This function, `F_gravity`, returns a value. This is provided by the `return` statement. As you may have observed, the values $m_1$, $m_2$ and $r$ are provided as the first, the second and the third parameters, named as `m_1`, `m_2` and `r`, respectively. \n",
        "\n",
        "But what about `G`? It is not provided in the arguments and used in the return expression for its value. If the definition were a multi-statement definition (indented multi-statements following the `def` line), then Python would seek for a defined value for `G` among them. But this is not even the case, so the last alternative is to seek a value in the `global` environment, the environment in which `F_gravity` is called.\n",
        "\n",
        "Therefore, before we call `F_gravity`, we must make sure that a value for a global variable `G` (which apparently is the *Gravitational Constant*) is set. In the **Scope of Variables** section, we will be handling the rules of this to a greater extent."
