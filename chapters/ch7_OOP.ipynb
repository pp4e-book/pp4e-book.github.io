        "At this stage of programming, you must have realized that programming possesses some idiosyncrasies:\n",
        "\n",
        " * Unless a randomization is explicitly build in, all computations are deterministic; i.e., the result is always the same for the same input.\n",
        " * The logic involved is binary; i.e., two truth values exist: True and False.\n",
        " * There is a clear distinction of *actions* and *data*. Actions are coded into expressions, statements  and functions.  Data is coded into integers, floating points and containers (strings, tuples and lists).\n",
        "  \n",
        "The first two can be dealt with in a controlled manner. Furthermore, mostly it is very much preferred to have a crisp and deterministic outcome. But, the third is not so natural. The world we live in is not made of data and independent actions acting on that data. This is merely an abstraction. The need for this abstraction stems from the very nature of the computing device mankind has manufactured, the von Neumann Machine. What you store in the *memory* is either some data (integer or floating point) or some instruction. The *processor* processes the data based on a series of instructions. Therefore, we have a clear separation of data and action in computers. \n",
        "\n",
        "But when we look around, we don’t see such a distinction. We see *objects*. We see a tree, a house, a table, a computer, a notebook, a pencil, a lecturer and a student. Objects have some properties which would be quantified as data, but they also have some capabilities that would correspond to some actions. What about reuniting data and action under the natural concept of “object”? *Object Oriented Programming*, abbreviated as OOP, is the answer to this question.\n"

        "\n",
        "Encapsulation is the property that data and actions are glued together in a data-action structure called 'object' that conforms to a rule of “need-to-know” and “maximal-privacy”. In other words, an object should provide access only to data and actions that are needed by other objects and other data & actions that are not needed should be hidden and used by the object itself for its own merit.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is important especially to keep implementation modular and manageable: An object stores some data and implements certain actions. Some of these are private and hidden from other objects whereas others are *public* to other objects so that they can access such public data and actions to suit their needs.\n",
        "\n",
        "The public data and actions function as the interface of the object to the outside world. In this way, objects interact with each other's interfaces by accessing public data and actions. This can be considered as a message passing mechanism: Object1 calls Object2's action f, which calls Object3's function g, which returns a message (a value) back to Object2, which, after some calculation returns another value to Object 1. As a realistic example of a university registration system, assume `Student` object calls `register` action of a `Course` object and it calls `checkPrerequisite` action of a `Curriculum` object. `checkPrerequisite` checks if course can be taken by student\n",
        "and returns the result. `register` action does additional controls and returns the success status of the registration to the `Student`.\n",
        "\n",

This hypothetical system gets a set of meteorological sensor data like humidity, pressure, temperature from various levels of atmosphere and try to estimate the weather conditions for the next couple of days.

The actions of such system would be a group of functions adding sensor data as they are measured and forecasting functions for getting the future estimate of weather conditions. For example:\n",

        " 1. When you need to have forecast of more than one location, you need to duplicate all data and maintain them separately. Keeping track of which list contains which location requires extra special care.\n",
        "\n",
        " 1. When you need to improve your code and change data representation like storing each sensor type on a separate sorted list by time, you need to change the action functions.

        " 1. Data and actions maintained together. Encapsulation mechanism guarantees that data exists and it has correct format and values.\n",
        "\n",

In the case of separate implementations of overlapping actions in each shape, we would have to update all overlapping actions if we want to correct an error in our implementation or switch to a more efficient algorithm for the overlapping actions. Therefore, it makes sense to implement the common functionalities in another object and reuse them whenever needed.\n",

First, the denominator can be 0, which leads to an invalid value. Second, many distinct tuples represent practically the same value and they need to be interpreted in a special way in operators like comparison. We need to either normalize all into their simplest form or implement comparison operators to respect the values they represent. In the following implementation, we choose the first approach: We find greatest common divisor of numerator and denominator and normalize them."

        "\n",
        "Now we have an interesting phenomenon. `draw` is even not defined in `shape`. It will be defined differently for each class that is derived from the `shape` base class. How can a function of `shape` make a reference to a function which does not exist for `shape` and will only be defined in classes that are descendants of this base class? Also note that the each of the descendant classes (`circle` and `rectangle`) are going to define it (the `draw` function) their own way. This is called forward-referencing and polymorphism, a nice and powerful feature of OOP.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that the class definitions (`class shape`, `class circle`, `class rectangle`) are merely blueprints. They do not create any data. They define how they will be created and which functions will act how. The actual creation (based on these blueprints) are done in the code in the last (turquoise colored) box. \n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, the code below performs the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "* An instance of the `circle class` is created (by calling its initializer) at coordinates (`100`,`100`) with a radius of `50`. This instance is stored into the variable `mycircle`.\n",
        "* The color of this freshly created object is changed to the brightest red. \n",
        "* The object's `draw` function is called (in OOP jargon: a `draw` message is sent to the object stored in  `mycircle`) \n",
        "* Similarly, an instance of `rectangle class` is created at  coordinates (`200`,`100`)  and with `width=50`, `height=80`. This instance is stored into the variable `myrectangle`.\n",
        "* The color of the rectangle is changed to the brightest green. \n",
        "* The  rectangles  `draw` function is called.\n",
        "* The program pauses (waits) for `1` second. \n",
        "* Finally, it calls the displace function of the rectangle. Though it was defined in the base class, `displace` locates the correct `draw` (the draw of the rectangle) and performs the job.  \n"

        "(no space after the dot).\n",
        "\n",
        "* There is no proper destructor in Python. This is because the Python engine does all the memory allocation and book-keeping. Though entirely under the control of Python, sometimes the so-called _Garbage Collection_ is carried out. At that moment, all unused object instances are wiped out of the memory. Before that, a special member function `__del__` is called. If you want to do a special treatment of an object before it is wiped forever, you can define the `__del__` function.  The concept of garbage collection is complex and it is wrong to assume that `__del__` will right away be called even if an object instance is deleted by the `del` statement (`del` will mark the object as unused but it will not necessarily trigger a garbage collection phase).\n",
        "\n",
        "* Infix operators have special, associated member functions (those that start and end with double underscores). If you want your objects to participate in infix expressions, then you have to define those. For example '`+`' has the associated special member function `__add__`. For a complete list and how-to-do's, search for \"special functions of Python\" and \"operator overloading\".\n",

You are expected to define all member functions present in `circle` or `rectangle`, this time for `triangle`. For the `draw` member function, you can investigate the content of the `draw` of the `rectangle` class.  \n",
