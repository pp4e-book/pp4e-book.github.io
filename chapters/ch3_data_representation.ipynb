If we do this, when the left-most digit is a '1',  the rest of the digits are encoding the magnitude of the 'negative' integer. One point to be mentioned is that this requires a fixed size (a fixed number of digits) for the 'integer representation'. In this way, the electronics can recognize the sign bit and the magnitude part. This is called *the sign-magnitude notation*.\n",

Let us assume you provide your program the Pi number to be 3.1415. You do your calculations and obtain floating point numbers with 14-15 digit fractional parts. Knowing about the precision loss, you assume that maybe a couple of the last digits are wrong but at least 10 digits after the decimal point are correct. However, this is a mistake: You made an approximation in the 5th digit after the decimal point in number Pi which will propagate through your calculation. It can get worse (for example if you subtract two very close numbers and use it in the denominator), but can never get better. Your best chance is to get a correct result in the 4th digit after the decimal point. The following digits, as far as precision is concerned, are bogus.\n",

        "* Use less precision floating points only when you are in short of memory.\n",
        "* Subtracting two floating points close in value has a potential danger.  \n",
        "* If you add or subtract two numbers which are magnitude-wise not comparable (one very big the other very small),\n",

Interestingly Python adopts a seamless internal representation so that integers can effectively have any number of digits. The internal mechanism of Python switches from the CPU-imposed fixed-size integers to some elaborated big-integer representation silently when needed. You do not have to worry about it. Furthermore, bear in mind that \"73.\" is **not** an integer in Python. It is a floating point number (73.0). An integer cannot have a decimal point as part of it.\n",

For example, 1.45, 0.26, and -99.0 are float but 102 and -8 are not. We can also use the scientific notation ($a \\times 10^b$) to write floating point numbers. For example, float 0.0000000436 can be written in scientific notation as $4.36 \\times 10^{-8}$ and in Python as 4.36E-8 or 4.36e-8.\n",

The `j` symbol (or $i$) represents $\\sqrt{-1}$. There are other ways to create complex numbers, but this is the most natural way, considering your previous knowledge from high school.\n",

As far as the string is concerned, the usage of the 'address concept' was simple:  A single address marks the start of the string. When we want to process the string, we go to this address and then start to process the character codes sequentially.\n",

This type of organizations are name _Data Structures_ in Computer Science. So, string is a data structure. As far as Python is concerned, there are several other data structures. They are coined in Python as _containers_. In addition to strings Python provide lists, tuples, sets and dictionaries as containers. "
