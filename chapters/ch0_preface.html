<h3>a. Target audience of the book<a class="headerlink" href="#a-target-audience-of-the-book" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>This book is intended to be an accompanying textbook for teaching
programming to science and engineering students with no prior
programming expertise. This endeavour requires a delicate balance
between providing details on computers &amp; programming in a complete
manner and the programming needs of science and engineering disciplines.
With the hopes of providing a suitable balance, the book uses Python as
the programming language, since it is easy to learn and program.
Moreover, for keeping the balance, the book is formed of three parts:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Part I: The Basics of Computers and Computing</strong>: The book starts
with what computation is, introduces both the present-day hardware
and software infrastructure on which programming is performed and
introduces the spectrum of programming languages.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Part II: Programming with Python</strong>: The second part starts with the
basic building blocks of Python programming and continues with
providing the ground formation for solving a problem in to Python.
Since almost all science and engineering libraries in Python are
written with an object-oriented approach, a gentle introduction to
this concept is also provided in this part.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Part III: Using Python for Science and Engineering Problems</strong>: The
last part of the book is dedicated to practical and powerful tools
that are widely used by various science and engineering disciplines.
These tools provide functionalities for reading and writing data
from/to files, working with data (using e.g.Â algebraic, numerical or
statistical computations) and plotting data. These tools are then
utilized in example problems and applications at the end of the book.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>b. How to use the book<a class="headerlink" href="#b-how-to-use-the-book" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>This is an âinteractiveâ book with a rather âminimalistâ approach: Some
details or specialized subjects are not emphasized and instead, direct
interaction with examples and problems are encouraged. Therefore, rather
than being a âcomplete reference manualâ, this book is a âfirst things
firstâ and âhands onâ book. The pointers to skipped details will be
provided by links in the book. Bearing this in mind, the reader is
strongly encouraged to read and interact all contents of the book
thoroughly.</p>
<p>The bookâs interactivity is thanks to <a class="reference external" href="https://jupyter.org">Jupyter
notebook</a>. Therefore, the book differs from a
conventional book by providing some dynamic content. This content can
appear in audio-visual form as well as some applets (small applications)
embedded in the book. It is also possible that the book asks the the
reader to complete/write a piece of Python program, run it, and inspect
the result, from time to time. The reader is encouraged to complete
these minor tasks. Such tasks and interactions are of great assistance
in gaining acquaintance with Python and building up a self-confidence in
solving problems with Python.</p>
<p>Thanks to Jupyter notebook running solutions on the Internet
(e.g.Â <a class="reference external" href="https://colab.research.google.com/">Google Colab</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/">Jupyter
Notebook Viewer</a>), there is absolutely
no need to install any application on the computer. You can directly
download and run the notebook on Colab or Notebook Viewer. Though, since
it is faster and it provides better virtual machines, the links to all
Jupyter notebooks will be served on Colab.</p>

<h2>ii. What is computing?<a class="headerlink" href="#ii-what-is-computing" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>Computing is the process of inferring data from data. What is going to
be inferred is defined as the <em>task</em>. The original data is called the
<em>input (data)</em> and the inferred one is the <em>output (data)</em>.</p>
<p>Let us look at some examples:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Multiplying two numbers, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Y\)</span>, and subtracting
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1\)</span> from the multiplication is a <em>task</em>. The two numbers
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Y\)</span> are the <em>input</em> and the result of
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(X\times Y - 1\)</span> is the <em>output</em></p></li>
<li><p>Recognizing the faces in a digital picture is a <em>task</em>. Here the
<em>input</em> is the color values (3 integers) for each point (pixel) of
the picture. The <em>output</em> is, as you would expect, the pixel
positions that belong to faces. In other words, the output can be a
set of numbers.</p></li>
<li><p>The board instance of a chess game, as <em>input</em>, where black has made
the last move. The task is to predict the best move for white. The
best move is the <em>output</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>input</em> is a set of three-tuples which look like <strong>&lt;Age_of_death,
Height, Gender&gt;</strong>. The <em>task</em>, an optimization problem in essence, is
to find out the curve (i.e.Â the function) that goes through these
tuples in a 3D dimensional space spanned by Age, Height and Gender.
As you have guessed already, the <em>output</em> is the parameters defining
the function and an error describing how well the curve goes through
the tuples.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>input</em> is a sentence to a chatbot. The <em>task</em> is to determine
the sentence (the <em>output</em>) that best follows the input sentence in a
conversation.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These examples suggest that computing can involve different types of
data, either as input or output: Numbers, images, sets, or sentences.
Although this variety might appear intimidating at first, we will see
that, by using some âsolution building blocksâ, we can do computations
and solve various problems with such a wide spectrum of data.</p>

<h2>iii. Are all âcomputing machineryâ alike?<a class="headerlink" href="#iii-are-all-computing-machinery-alike" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>Certainly not! This is a common mistake a layman does. There are diverse
architectures based on totally different physical phenomena that can
compute. A good example is the <em>brain</em> of living beings, which rely on
completely different mechanisms compared to the <em>micro processors</em>
sitting in our laptops, desktops, mobile phones and calculators.</p>
<p>The building blocks of a <em>brain</em> is the <em>neuron</em>, a cell that has
several input channels, called <em>dendrites</em> and a single output channel,
the <em>axon</em>, which can branch like a tree (see
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-ch0-single-neuron"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 1</span></a>).</p>

<p>The branches of an axon, each carrying the same information, connect to
other neuronsâ dendrites (<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-ch0-synapse"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 2</span></a>). The connection
with another neuron is called the <em>synapse</em>. What travels through the
synapse are called <em>neurotransmitters</em>. Without going into details, one
can simplify the action of neurotransmitters as messengers that cause an
excitation or inhibition on the receiving end. In other words, the
neurotransmitters, through a chemical process along the axon, are
released into the synapse as the âoutputâ of the neuron, they âinteractâ
with the dendrite (i.e.Â the âinputâ) of another neuron and potentially
lead to an excitation or an inhibition.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, the synapse is like a valve, which reduces the
neurotransmittersâ flow. We will come to this in a second. Now, all the
neurotransmitters flown in through the input channels (dendrites) have
an accumulative effect on the (receiving) neuron. The neuron emits a
neurotransmitter burst through its axon. This emission is not a
âwhat-comes-in-goes-outâ type. It is more like the curve in
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-ch0-activation-potential"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 3</span></a>.</p>

<p>The throughput of the synapse is something that may vary with time. Most
synapses have the ability to ease the flow over time if the
neurotransmitter amount that entered the synapse was constantly high.
High activity widens the synaptic connection. The reverse also happens:
Less activity over time narrows the synaptic connection.</p>
<p>Some neurons are specialized in creating neurotransmitter emission under
certain physical effects. Retina neurons, for example, create
neurotransmitters if light falls on them. Some, on the other hand,
create physical effects, like creating an electric potential that will
activate a muscle cell. These specialized neurons feed the huge neural
net, the brain, with inputs and receive outputs from it.</p>
<p>The human brain, containing about <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10^{11}\)</span> such neurons with each
neuron being connected to 1000-5000 other neurons by the mechanism
explained above, is a very unique computing âmachineâ that inspires
computational sciences.</p>

<center><p><i>Video 1. A detailed illustration of how neurotransmitters are transmitted at synapses.
  [Video from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhowH0kb7n0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhowH0kb7n0</a>]</i></p></center><p>The brain never stops processing information and the functioning of each
neuron is only based on signals (the neurotransmitters) it receives
through its connections (dendrites). There is no common synchronization
timing device for the computation: i.e.Â each neuron behaves on its own
and functions in parallel.</p>
<p>An interesting phenomenon of the brain is that the information and the
processing are distributed. Thanks to this feature, when a couple of
neurons die (which actually happens each day) no information is lost
completely.</p>
<p>On the contrary to the brain, which uses varying amounts of chemicals
(neurotransmitters), the microprocessor based computational machinery
uses the existence and absence of an electric potential. The information
is stored very locally. The microprocessor consists of subunits but they
are extremely specialized in function and far less in number compared to
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10^{11}\)</span> all alike neurons. In the brain, changes take place at a
pace of 50 Hz maximum, whereas this pace is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10^{9}\)</span> Hz in a
microprocessor.</p>
<p>In Chapter 1, we will take a closer look at the microprocessor machinery
which is used by todayâs computers. Just to make a note, there are
man-made computing architectures other than the microprocessor. A few to
mention would be the âanalog computerâ, the âquantum computerâ and the
âconnection machineâ.</p>

<li><p><strong>The broader context:</strong> Any physical entity that can do
âcomputationâ.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The most common context:</strong> An electronic device that has a
âmicroprocessorâ in it.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>From now on, âcomputerâ will refer to the second meaning, namely a
device that has a âmicroprocessorâ.</strong></p>
<p>A computerâ¦</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>is based on binary (0/1) representations such that all inputs are
converted to 0s and 1s and all outputs are converted from 0/1
representations to a desired form, mostly a human-readable one. The
processing takes places on 0s and 1s, where 0 has the meaning of âno
electric potentialâ (no voltage, no signal) and 1 has the meaning of
âsome fixed electric potential (usually 5 Volts, a signal).</p></li>
<li><p>consists of two clearly distinct entities: The Central Processing
Unit (CPU), also known as the microprocessor (ðP), and a <em>Memory</em>. In
addition to these, the computer is connected to or incorporates other
electronic units, mainly for input-output, known as âperipheralsâ.</p></li>
<li><p>performs a âtaskâ by executing a sequence of instructions, called a
âprogramâ.</p></li>
<li><p>is deterministic. That means if a âtaskâ is performed under the same
conditions, it will produce always the same result. It is possible to
include randomization in this process only by making use of a
peripheral that provides electronically random inputs.</p></li>

<h2>v. What is programming?<a class="headerlink" href="#v-what-is-programming" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>The CPU (the microprocessor - ðP) is able to perform several types of
actions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Arithmetic operations on binary numbers that represent (encode)
integers or decimal numbers with fractional part.</p></li>
<li><p>Operations on binary representations (like shifting of digits to the
left or right; inverting 0s and 1s).</p></li>
<li><p>Transferring to/from memory.</p></li>
<li><p>Comparing numbers (e.g.Â whether a number <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n_1\)</span> larger than
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n_2\)</span>) and performing alternative actions based on such
comparisons.</p></li>
<li><p>Communicating with the peripherals.</p></li>
<li><p>Alternating the course of the actions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Each such unit action is recognized by the CPU as an <em>instruction</em>. In
more technically terms, tasks are solved by a CPU by executing a
sequence of instructions. Such sequences of instructions are called
machine codes. Constructing machine codes for a CPU is called âmachine
code programmingâ.</p>
<p>But, programming has a broader meaning:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><em>a series of steps to be carried out or goals to be accomplished.</em></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>And, as far as computer programming is concerned, we would certainly
like these steps to be expressed in a more natural (more human readable)
manner, compared to binary machine codes. Thankfully, there exist
âmachine code programsâ that read-in such âmore naturalâ programs and
convert them into âmachine code programsâ or immediately carry out those
ânaturally expressedâ steps.</p>
<p>Python is such a âmore natural wayâ of expressing programming steps.</p>
