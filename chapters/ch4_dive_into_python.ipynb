Interestingly Python adopts a seamless internal representation so that integers can effectively have any number of digits.

For example, 1.45, 0.26, and -99.0 are float but 102 and -8 are not. We can also use the scientific notation ($a \\times 10^b$) to write floating point numbers. For example, float 0.0000000436 can be written in scientific notation as $4.36 \\times 10^{-8}$ and in Python as 4.36E-8 or 4.36e-8.\n",

The `j` symbol (or $i$) represents $\\sqrt{-1}$. There are other ways to create complex numbers, but this is the most natural way, considering your previous knowledge from highschool.\n",

Likewise, (`\"`) can be escaped: `\"\\\"hello\\\"\"` is a string that begins and ends with the literal double quote character. Finally, (`\\`) can be used to escape itself: (`\\\\`) is the literal backslash character.

Due to your high school background, this is certainly easy to understand. The second construct is something new. It appears that we can use some functions suffixed by a dot to a container (e.g. the `append` and `insert` usages in the examples above). This construct is an internal function call of data structure called _object_. Containers are actually objects and in addition to their data containment property, they also have some defined action associations. These actions are named as _member functions_, and called (applied) on that object (in our case -the container-) by means of this dot notation:\n",

Till then simply interpret it based on the equivalence depicted above. "
