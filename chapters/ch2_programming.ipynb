So, at the worst case, it will take $m$ turns till $1000/2^m$ gets down to 1 (the one remaining number, which has to be the hidden number). So, obviously $m=\\log_2(1000)$. For 1000 this means approximately 10 turns ($2^{10}=1024$). If we double the range, $m$ would change only by 1 (yes, think about it, only 11 turns).  \n",

This is symbolized with $n$.  $\\cal{O}(\\log(n))$ is the quantitative information about the algorithm which tells that the solution time is proportional to $\\log(n)$. This information about an algorithm is named as _complexity_.\n",

        "1. **Compilative Approach**. In this approach, a translator, named as _compiler_, takes a high-level programming language  program as input and converts all the actions into  a  machine code program (<font color=gray>Figure 2.5</font>). The outcome is a machine code program that can be run any time (by asking the OS to do so) and does the job described in the high-level language program. Conceptually this is correct, but actually, this schema has another step in-the-loop. The compiler produces an almost complete machine code with some holes in it. These holes are about the parts of the code which is not actually coded by the programmer, but filled in from a pre-created machine code library (it is actually named as _library_). A program, named _linker_ fills those holes. Linker knows about the library and patches in the parts of the code that are referenced by the programmer.\n",

In this approach, a machine code program, named as _interpreter_, when run, inputs and processes the high-level program line by line (<font color=gray>Figure 2.6</font>). After taking a line as input, the actions described in the line are *immediately* executed; if the action is printing some value, the output is printed right away; if it is an evaluation of a mathematical expression, all values are substituted and at that very point-in-time, the expression is evaluated to calculate the result. In other words, any action is carried out immediately when the interpreter comes to its line in the program. In practice, it is always possible to write down the program lines into a file, and make the interpreter read the program lines one by one from that file as well.\n",

        "Both approaches have their benefits. When a specific task is considered,  compilers generate fast executing machine codes compared to the same task being carried out by an interpreter. On the other hand compilers are  unpleasant when trial-and-errors are possible during the task realization. Interpreters, on the other hand, allow making small changes and the programmer receives immediate responses, which makes it easier to observe intermediate results and adjust the algorithm accordingly. However, interpreters are slower since they involve an interpretation component while running the code. Sometimes this slowness is by a factor of 20. Therefore, the interpretive approach is good for quick implementations whereas using a compiler  is good for computation intense big projects or time-tight tasks. "

        "\n",
        "As we mentioned before, there are more than 700 programming languages. Certainly some are for academic purposes and some did not gain any popularity. But there are about 20 programming languages which are commonly used for writing programs. How do we choose one?\n",
        "\n",
        "Picking a particular programming language is not just a matter of taste. During the course of the evolution of the programming languages, different strategies or world views about programming have also developed. These world views are reflected in the programming languages. For example, one world view regards the programming task as transforming some initial data (the initial information that defines the problem) into a final form (the data that is the answer to that problem) by applying a sequence of functions. From this perspective, writing a program consists of defining some functions which are then used in a functional composition; a composition which, when applied to some initial data, yields the answer to the problem. \n",
        "\n",
        "This concept of world views are coined as _programming paradigms_. The Oxford dictionary defines the word paradigm as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "> **paradigm** $|$'parǝ,dïm$|$\n",
        ">\n",
        "> _noun_\n",
        ">\n",
        "> A world view underlying the theories and methodology of a particular scientific subject.\n",
        "\n",
        "Below is a list of some major paradigms:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **_Imperative_**: Is a paradigm where programming statements and their composition directly map to the machine code segments, so that the whole machine code is covered. \n",
        "\n",
        "* **_Functional_**: In this paradigm, solving a programming task is to construct a group of functions so that their 'functional composition' acting on the initial data produces the solution.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **_Object oriented_**: In this paradigm the compulsory separation (due to the von Neumann architecture) of algorithm from data is lifted, and algorithm and data are reunited under an artificial computational entity: _the object_. An object  has algorithmic properties as well as data properties. \n",
        "\n",
        "* **_Logical-declarative_**: This is the most contrasting view compared to the imperative paradigm. The idea is to represent logical and mathematical relations among entities (as rules) and then ask an inference engine for a solution that satisfies all rules. The inference engine is a kind of 'prover', i.e. a program, that is constructed by the inventor of the logical-declarative programming language. \n",
        "\n",
        "* **_Concurrent_**: A paradigm where independent computational entities work towards the solution of a problem.  For problems that can be solved by a divide-and-conquer strategy this paradigm is very suitable. \n",
        "\n",
        "* **_Event driven_**: This paradigm considers a world of events into programming. Events are assumed to be asynchronous and they have 'handlers', i.e. programs that carry out the actions associated with that particular event. Programming graphical user interfaces (GUIs) is usually performed using event-driven languages: An event in a GUI is generated e.g. when the user clicks the \"Close\" button, which triggers the execution of a handler function that performs the associated closing action.\n",
        "\n",
        "In contrary to the layman programmers' assumption, these paradigms are <u>not</u> mutually exclusive. Many paradigms can very well co-exist in a programming language together. At a meta level, we can call them 'orthogonal' to each other. This is why we have so many programming languages around. A language can provide imperative as well as functional and object-oriented constructs. Then it is up to the programmer to blend them in his or her particular program.  As it is with many 'world views' among humans, in the field of programming, fanaticism exists too. You can meet individuals that do only functional programming or object-oriented programming. We better consider them outliers. \n",
        "\n",
        "Python, the subject language of this book, supports strongly the imperative, functional and object-orient paradigms. It also provides some functionality in other paradigms by some modules. "

The first version was released in 1991 and with the second version released in 2000, it started gaining a wider interest from the community.
