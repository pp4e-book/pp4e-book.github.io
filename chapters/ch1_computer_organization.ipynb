The reality is that there is an external input to the CPU from which electronic pulses are fed. This input is called the _system clock_ and each period of it is named as a _clock cycle_. The best performance would be that each phase of the fetch-decode-execute cycle is completed in one-and-only-one clock cycle. On modern CPUs, this is true for addition instruction, for example.

        "Though it is somewhat contrary to your expectation, any device outside of the von Neumann structure, namely the CPU and the Memory, is a _peripheral_. In this aspect, even the keyboard, the mouse and the display are peripherals. So are the USB and ethernet connections and the internal hard disk. Explaining the technical details of how those devices are connected to the von Neumann architecture is out of the scope of this book. Though, we can summarize it in a few words. \n",
        "\n",
        "All devices are electronically listening to the busses (the address and data bus) and to a wire running out of the CPU (which is <u>not</u> pictured above) which is 1 or 0. This wire is called the _port_io_ line and tells the memory devices as well as to any other device that listens to the busses whether the CPU is talking to the (real) memory or not. If it is talking to the memory all the other listeners keep quiet. But if the port_io line is 1, meaning the CPU doesn't talk to the memory but to the device which is electronically sensitive to that specific address that was put on the address bus (by the CPU), then that device jumps up and responds (through the data bus). The CPU can send as well as receive data from that particular device. A computer has some precautions to prevent address clashes, i.e. two devices responding to the same address information in port_io. \n",
        "\n",
        "Another mechanism aids communication requests initiated from the peripherals. Of course it would be possible for the CPU from time to time stop and do a port_io on all possible devices, asking them for any data they want to send in. This technique is called _polling_ and is extremely inefficient for devices that send asynchronous data (data that is send in irregular intervals): You cannot know when there will be a keyboard entry so, in polling, you have to ask very frequently the keyboard device for the existence of any data. Instead of  dealing with the inefficiency of polling, another mechanism is built into the CPU. The interrupt mechanism is an electronic circuitry of the CPU which has inlets (wires) connected to the peripheral devices. When a device wants to communicate with (send or receive some data to/from) the CPU they send a signal (1) from that specific wire. This gets the attention of the CPU, the CPU stops what it is doing at a convenient point in time, and asks the device for a port_io. So the device gets a chance to send/receive data to/from the CPU.

Therefore, there must be a machine code in a memory which, even when the power is off, does not lose its content, very much like a flash drive. It is electronically located exactly at the address where the CPU looks for its first instruction. This memory, with its content, is called Basic Input Output System, or in short BIOS. In the former days, the BIOS was manufactured as write-only-once. To change the program, a chip had to be replaced with a new one.

        "\n",
        "The operating system is a program that, after being loaded into the memory, manages resources and services like the use of memory, the CPU and the devices. It essentially hides the internal details of the hardware and makes the ugly binary machine understandable and manageable to us. \n",
        "\n",
        "An OS has the following responsibilities:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **_Memory Management_**: Refers to the management of the memory connected to the CPU. In modern computers, there is more than one machine code program loaded into the memory. Some programs are initiated by the user (like a browser, document editor, Word, music player, etc.) and some are initiated by the operating system. The CPU switches very fast from one program (this is called a _process_) in the memory to another. The user (usually) does not feel the switching. The memory manager keeps track of the space allocated by processes in the memory. When a new program (process) is being started, it has to be placed into the memory. The memory manager decides where it is going to be placed. Of course, when a process ends, the place in the memory occupied by the process has to be reclaimed; that is the memory manager's job. It is also possible that, while running, a process demands additional space in the memory (e.g. a photoshop-like program needs more space for a newly opened JPG image file) then the process makes this demand to the memory manager, which grants it or denies it.  \n",
        "\n",
        "- **_Process (Time) Management_**: As said above, a modern memory generally contains more than one machine code program. An electronic mechanism forces the CPU to switch to the _Time Manager_ component of the OS. At least 20 times a second, the time manager is invoked to make a decision on behalf of the CPU: Which of the processes that sit in the memory will be run during the next period? When a process gets the turn, the current state of the CPU (the contents of all registers) is saved to some secure position in the memory, in association to the last executing process. From that secure position, the last saved state information which going to take the turn is found and the CPU is set to that state. Then the CPU, for a period of time executes that process. At the end of that period, the CPU switches over to the time manager and the time manager makes a decision for the next period. Which process will get the turn? And so on. This decision making is a complex task. Still there are Ph.D. level research going on on this subject. The time manager collects some statistics about each individual process and its system resource utilization. Also there is the possibility that a process has a high priority associated due to several reasons. The time manager has to solve a kind of optimization problem under some constraints. As mentioned, this is a complex task and a hidden quality factor of an OS.  \n",
        "\n",
        "- **_Device Management_**: All external devices of a computer have a software plug-in to the operating system. An operating system has some standardized demands from devices and these software plug-ins implement these standardized functionality.  This software is usually provided by the device manufacturer and is loaded into the operating system as a part of the device installation process. These plug-ins are named as _device drivers_.\n",
        "\n",
        "  An Operating System performs device communication  by means of these  drivers. It does the following activities for device management:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Keeps tracks of all devices' status.\n",
        "  - Decides which process gets access to the device when and for how long.\n",
        "  - Implements some intelligent caching, if possible, for the data communication with the device. \n",
        "  - De-allocates devices.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **_File Management_**: A computer is basically a data processing machine. Various data are produced or used for very diverse purposes. Textual, numerical, audio-visual data are handled. Handling data also includes _storing_ and _retrieving_ it on some external recording device. Examples for such recording devices are hard disks, flash drives, CDs and DVDs. Data is stored on these devices as files. A _file_ is a persistent piece of information that has a name, some meta data (e.g. information about the owner, the creation time, size, content type, etc.) and the data. \n",
        "\n",
        "  The organizational mechanism for how files are stored on devices is called the _file system_. There are various alternatives to do this. FAT16, FAT32, NTFS, EXT2, EXT3, ExFAT, HFS+ are a few of about a hundred (actually the most common ones). Each has its own pros and cons as far as _max allowed file size, security, robustness (repairability), extensibility, metadata, lay out policies_ and some other aspects are concerned. Files are most often managed in a hierarchy. This is achieved by a concept of _directories_ or _folders_. On the surface (as far as the user sees them), a file system usually consist of files separated into directories where directories can contain files or other directories. \n",
        "\n",
        "  The file manager is responsible for creation & initialization of a file system, inclusion and removal of devices from this system and management of all sorts of changes in the file system: Creation, removal, copying of files and directories, dynamically assigning access rights for files and directories to processes etc. \n",
        "\n",
        "- **_Security_**: This is basically for the maintenance of the computer's integrity, availability, and confidentiality. The security of  a computer exists at various layers such as:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * maintaining the physical security of the computer system, \n",
        "  * the security of the information the system is in hold of, and\n",
        "  * the security of the network to which the computer is connected. \n",
        "\n",
        "  In all of these, the operating system plays a vital role in keeping the security. Especially the second item is where the operating system is involved at most. Information, as you know by now, is placed in the computer in two locations. The internal memory and the external storage devices. The internal memory is in hold of the processes and the processes should not interfere with each other (unless specifically intended). Actually in a modern day computer, there can be more than one user working at the same time on the computer. Their processes running in the memory as well as their files being on the file system must remain extremely private and separate. Even their existence has to be hidden from every other user.    \n",
        "\n",
        "  Computers are connected and more and more integrated in a global network. This integration is done on a spectrum of interactions. In the extreme case, a computer can be solely controlled over the network. Of course this is done by supplying some credentials but, as you would guess, such a system is prone to malicious attacks. An operating system has to take measures to protect the computer system from such harms. Sometimes it is the case that bugs of the OS are discovered and exploited in order to breach security.  \n",
        "\n",
        "- **_User Interface_**: As the computer's user, when you want to do anything you do this by ordering the operating system to do it.  Starting/terminating a program, exploring or modifying the file system, installing/uninstalling a new device are all done by \"talking\" to the operating system. For this purpose, an OS provides an interface, coined as the _user interface_. In the older days, this was done by typing some cryptic commands into a typewriter at a console device. Over the years, the first computer with a _Graphical User Interface (GUI)_ emerged. A GUI is a visual interface to the user where  the screen can host several windows each dedicated to a different task. Elements of the operating system (processes, files, directories, devices, network communications) and their status are symbolized by icons and the interactions are mostly via moving and clicking a pointing device which is another icon (usually a movable arrow) on the screen.  The [**_Xerox Alto_**](https://github.com/sinankalkan/CENG240/blob/master/figures/XeroxAlto.jpg?raw=true) introduced on March 1973 was the first computer that had a GUI. The first personal computer with a GUI was [**_Apple Lisa_**](https://github.com/sinankalkan/CENG240/blob/master/figures/AppleLisa.jpg?raw=true), introduced in 1983 with a price of $10,000. Almost three years later, by the end of 1985, Microsoft released its first OS with a GUI: Windows 1.0.  The archaic console typing still exists, in the form a type-able window, called terminal, which is still very much favoured among programming professionals because it provides more control for the OS."
