A Broad Look at Programming and Programming Languages
=====================================================

The previous chapter provided a closer look at how a modern computer
works. In this chapter, we will first look at how we generally solve
problems with such computers. Then, we will see that a programmer does
not have to control a computer using the binary machine code
instructions we introduced in the previous chapter: We can use
human-readable instructions and languages to make things easy for
programming.

How do we solve problems with programs?
---------------------------------------

The von Neumann machine, on which computers’ design is based, makes a
clear distinction between instruction and data (do not get confused by
the machine code holding both data and instructions: The data field in
such instructions are generally addresses of the data to be manipulated
and therefore, data and instructions exist as different entities in
memory). Due to this clear distinction between data and instruction, the
solutions to world problems were approached and handled with this
distinction in mind (:numref:`fig_ch2_solving_world_problems`):

   *“For solving world problems, the first task of the programmer is to
   identify the information to be processed to solve the problem. This
   information is called data. Then, the programmer has to find an
   action schema that will act upon this data, carry out those actions
   according to the plan, and produce a solution to the problem. This
   well-defined action schema is called an algorithm.”*

   Solving a world problem with a computer requires first designing how
   the data is going to be represented and specifying the steps which
   yield the solution when executed on the data. This design of the
   solution is then written (implemented) in a programming language to
   be executed as a program such that, when executed, the program
   outputs the solution for the world problem. [From: `G. Üçoluk, S.
   Kalkan, Introduction to Programming Concepts with Case Studies in
   Python, Springer,

Algorithm
---------

An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure that, when executed, leads to
an output for the input we provided. If the procedure was correct, we
expect the output to be the desired output, i.e. the solution we wanted
for the algorithm to compute.

Algorithms can be thought of as recepies for cooking. This analogy makes
sense since we would define a recipe as a step-by-step procedure for
cooking something: Each step performs a little action (cutting, slicing,
stirring etc.) that brings us closer to the outcome, the meal.

This is exactly the case in algorithms as well: At each step, we make a
small progress towards the solution by performing a small computation
(e.g. adding numbers, finding the minimum of a set of real numbers
etc.). The only difference with cooking is that each step needs to be
*understandable* by the computer; otherwise, it is not an algorithm.

The origins of the world ‘algorithm’

.. container::

   The word ‘algorithm’ comes from the Latin word *algorithmi*, which is
   the Latinized name of Al-Khwarizmi. Al-Khwarizmi was a Persian
   Scientist who has written a book on algebra titled “The Compendious
   Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing” during 813–833 which
   presented the first systematic solution of linear and quadratic
   equations. His contributions established algebra, which stems from
   his method of “al-jabr” (meaning “completion” or “rejoining”). The
   reason the world algorithm is attributed to Al-Khwarizmi is because
   he proposed systematic methods for solving equations using sequences
   of well-defined instructions (e.g. “take all variables to the right.
   divide the coefficients by the coefficient of x…”) – i.e. using what
   we call today as algorithms.

\*\* Are algorithms the same thing as programs? \*\*

It is very natural to confuse algorithms with programs as they are both
step-by-step procedures. However, algorithms can be studied and they
were invented long before there were computers or programming languages.
We can design and study algorithms without using computers with just a
pen and paper. A program, on the other hand, is just an implementation
of an algorithm in a programming language. In other words, algorithms
are designs and programs are the written forms of these designs in
programming languages.

How to write algorithms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As we have discussed above, before programing our solution, we first
need to design it. While designing an algorithm, we generally use two
mechanisms:

1. **Pseudo-codes**. Pseudo-codes are natural language descriptions of
   the steps that need to be followed in the algorithm. It is not as
   specific or restricted as a programming language but it is not as
   free as the language we use for communicating with other humans: A
   pseudo-code should be composed of precise and feasible steps and
   avoid ambigous descriptions.

Here is an example pseudo-code:

*Algorithm 1. Calculate the average of numbers provided by the user.*

::

   Step 1: Get how many numbers will be provided and store that in N
   Step 2: Create a variable named Result with initial value 0
   Step 3: Execute the following step N times:
   Step 4:    Get the next number and add it to Result
   Step 5: Divide Result by N to obtain the result

2. **Flowcharts**. As an alternative to pseudocodes, we can use
   flowcharts while designing algorithms. Flowcharts are diagrams
   composed of small computational elements that describe the steps of
   the algorithm. An example in :numref:`fig_ch2_flowchart`
   illustrates what kind of elements are used and how they are brought
   together to describe an algorithm.

Flowcharts can be more intuitive to work with. However, for complex
algorithms, flowcharts can get very large and prohibitive to work with.

.. _fig_ch2_flowchart:

.. figure:: ../figures/ch2_flowchart_example.png
   :width: 600px

   Flowcharts describe relationships by using basic geometric symbols
   and arrows. The program start or end is depicted with an oval. A
   rectangular box denotes a simple action or status. Decision making is
   represented by a diamond and a parallelogram of the Input/Output
   process. A silhouette of a TV tube means displaying a message. The
   Internet is portrayed as a cloud.



How to compare algorithms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If two algorithms find the same solution are they of the same quality
For a second, recall a game we used to play when we were in primary
school: “Guess My Number”.

The rule is as follows: There is a setter and a guesser. The setter sets
a number from 1 to 1000 which s/he does not tell. The guesser has to
find this number. At each turn the guesser can propose any number from 1
to 1000. The setter answers by one of following:

-  **HIT:** The guesser found the number.
-  **LESSER:** The hidden number is less than the proposed one.
-  **GREATER:** The hidden number is greater than the proposed one.

In how many turns the number is found is recorded. The guesser and the
setter switch. This goes on for some agreed count of rounds. Whoever has
a lesser total turn count wins.

Many of you have played this game and certainly have observed that there
are three categories of children:

1. *Random guessers:* Worst category. Usually they cannot keep track of
   the answers and just based on the last answer they rondomly utter a
   number that cames to their mind. Quite possibly they repeat
   themselves.

2. Sweepers: They start at either 1 or 1000, and then systematically
   increase or decrease their proposal, e.g.:

   -  *-is it 1000?* Answer: LESSER
   -  *-is it 999?* Answer: LESSER
   -  -*is it 998?* Answer: LESSER

   … and so on. Certainly at some point such players do get a HIT. There
   is a group which decrease the number by two or three as well. With a
   first GREATER reply, they will start to increment by one.

3. *Middle seakers:* Keeping a possible lower and a possible upper value
   based on the reply they got, at every stage propose the number just
   in the middle of lower and upper values, e.g.:

   -  *-is it 500?* Answer: LESSER
   -  *-is it 250?* Answer: LESSER
   -  -*is it 125?* Answer: GREATER
   -  -*is it 187?* (which was (125+250)/2)? Answer: GREATER
   -  … and so on.

All three categories actually adopt different algorithms, which will
find the answer in the end. However, as you may have realised even as
you were a child, the first group peform the worst, then comes the
second group. The third group, if they do not make mistakes, are
unbeatable.

In other words, algorithms that aim to solve a certain problem may not
be of the same “quality”: Some perform better. This is so for all
algorithms and one of the challenges in Computer Science is to find
“better” algorithms. But, what is “better”? Is there a quantitative
measure for “better”ness? The answer is yes.

Let us look at this in the child game described above. First consider
the last group’s algorithm (the middle seekers). At every turn this kind
of seeker narrows down the search space by a factor of 1/2. So, at the
worst case, it will take :math:`m` turns till :math:`1000/2^m` gets down
to 1 (the one remaining number, which has to be the hidden number). So,
obviously :math:`m=\log_2(1000)`. For 1000 this means approximately 10
turns (:math:`2^{10}=1024`). If we double the range, :math:`m` would
change only by 1 (yes, think about it, only 11 turns).

We call such an algorithm of “order log(n)” or more technically,
:math:`\cal{O}(\log(n))`. In our case 1000 determines the ‘size’ of the
problem. This is symbolized with :math:`n`. :math:`\cal{O}(\log(n))` is
the quantitative information about the algorithm which tells that the
solution time is proportional to :math:`\log(n)`. This information about
an algorithm is named as *complexity*.

What about the sweepers algorithm for the problem above? In the worst
case, the sweeper would ask a question 1000 times (the correct number is
at the other end of the sequence). If the size (1000 in our case) is
symbolized with :math:`n`, then it will take a time proportional to
:math:`n` to reach the solution. In other words this algorithm’s
complexity is :math:`\cal{O}(n)`.

Certainly the algorithm that has :math:`\cal{O}(\log(n))` is better than
the one with :math:`\cal{O}(n)`, which is illustrated in
:numref:`fig_ch2_various_complexities`. In other words, an
:math:`\cal{O}(\log(n))` algorithm requires less number of steps and is
likely to run faster than the one with :math:`\cal{O}(n)` complexity.

.. _fig_ch2_various_complexities:

.. figure:: ../figures/ch2_various_complexities.png

   A plot of various complexities.


Data Representation
-------------------

The other crucial component of our solutions to world problems is the
data representation, which is the representation of the information
regarding the problem in a form that is most suitable for our algorithm.

If our problem is the calculation of the average of grades in a class,
then before implementing our solution, we need to determine how we are
going to represent the grades of students. This is what we are going to
determine in the ‘data representation’ part of our solution and to
discuss in :numref:chapter_3.

The World of Programming Languages
----------------------------------

Since the advent of computers, many programming languages have been
developed with different designs and levels of complexity. In fact,
there are about 700 programming languages - see, e.g. `the list of
programming
languages <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages_by_type>`__
that offer different abstraction levels (hiding the low-level details
from the programmer) and computational benefits (e.g. providing built-in
rule-search engine).

In this section, we will give a flavor of programming languages in terms
of abstraction levels (low-level vs. high-level – see
:numref:`fig_ch2_spectrum_of_PL`) as well as the computational
benefits they provide.

.. _fig_ch2_spectrum_of_PL:

.. figure:: ../figures/ch2_spectrum_of_PL.png

   The spectrum of programming languages, ranging from low-level
   languages to high-level languages and natural languages.


Low-level Languages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the previous chapter we have introduced the concept of machine code
program. A machine code program is an aggregate of instructions and
data, all being represented in terms of zeros (0) and ones (1). A
machine code is practically unreadable and very burdensome to create, as
we have seen before and illustrated below:

::

   01010101 01001000 10001001 11100101 10001011 00010101 10110010 00000011
   00100000 00000000 10001011 00000101 10110000 00000011 00100000 00000000
   00001111 10101111 11000010 10001001 00000101 10111011 00000011 00100000
   00000000 10111000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 11001001 11000011
   ...
   11001000 00000001 00000000 00000000  00000000 00000000

To overcome this, *assembly* language and assemblers were invented. An
assembler is a machine code program that serves as a translator from
some relatively more readable text, the assembly program, into machine
code. The key feature of an assembler is that each line of a assembly
program corresponds exactly to a single machine code instruction. As an
example, the binary machine code above can be written in an assembly
language as follows:

::

   main:
          pushq   %rbp
          movq    %rsp, %rbp
          movl    alice(%rip), %edx
          movl    bob(%rip), %eax
          imull   %edx, %eax
          movl    %eax, carol(%rip)
          movl    $0, %eax
          leave
          ret
   alice:
          .long   123
   bob:
          .long   456

**Pros of assembly**:

-  Instructions and registers have human recognizable mnemonic words
   associated. Like integer addition instruction being ``ADDI``, for
   example.
-  Numerical constants can be written down in human readable, base-10
   format, the assembler does the conversion to internal format.
-  Implements naming of memory positions that hold data. In other words
   has a primitive implementation of the variable concept.

**Cons of assembly**:

-  No arithmetic or logical expressions
-  No concept of functions
-  No concept of statement grouping
-  No concept of data containers

High-level Languages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To overcome the limitations of binary machine codes and the assembly
language, more capable *Programming Languages* were developed. We call
these languages *High-level languages*. These languages hide the
low-level details of the computer (and the CPU) and allow a programmer
to write code in a human-readable form.

A high-level programming language (or an assembly language) is defined,
similar to a natural language, by syntax (a set of grammar rules
governing how to bring together words) and semantics (the meaning –
i.e. what is meant by sequences of words in the syntax) associated for
the syntax. The syntax is based on keywords from a human language (due
to historical reasons, English). Using human-readable keywords eased
comprehension.

The following example is a program expressed in Python that asks for a
Fahrenheit value and prints its conversion into Celsius:

::

   Fahrenheit =  input("Please Enter Fahrenheit value:")
   print("Celsius equivalent is:", (Fahreheit − 32) * 5/9)

Here ``input`` and ``print`` are keywords of the language. The semantics
of both of them are self explanatory. ``Fahrenheit`` is a naming we have
chosen for a variable that will hold the input value.

High-level languages (*HL-languages* from now on) implement many
concepts which are not present at the machine code programming level.
Most outstanding features are:

-  human readable form of numbers and strings *(like decimal, octal,
   hexadecimal representations for numbers)*,
-  containers *(automatic allocation for places in the memory to hold
   data and naming them)*,
-  expressions *(calculation formulas based on operators which have
   precedences the way we are used to from mathematics)*,
-  constructs for repetitive execution *(conditional re-execution of
   code parts)*,
-  functions,
-  facilities for data organization *(ability to define new data types
   based on the primitive ones, organizing them in the memory in certain
   layouts)*.

Implementing with a High-level Language: Interpreter vs. Compiler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We can implement our solution in a programming language in two manners:

1. **Compilative Approach**. In this approach, a translator, named as
   *compiler*, takes a high-level programming language program as input
   and converts all the actions into a machine code program
   (:numref:`fig_ch2_compiler`). The outcome is a machine code program
   that can be run any time (by asking the OS to do so) and does the job
   described in the high-level language program. Conceptually this is
   correct, but actually, this schema has another step in-the-loop. The
   compiler produces an almost complete machine code with some holes in
   it. These holes are about the parts of the code which is not actually
   coded by the programmer, but filled in from a pre-created machine
   code library (it is actually named as *library*). A program, named
   *linker* fills those holes. Linker knows about the library and
   patches in the parts of the code that are referenced by the
   programmer.

.. _fig_ch2_compiler:

.. figure:: ../figures/ch2_compiler.png
   :width: 500px

   A program code in a high-level language is first translated into
   machine understandable binary code (machine code) which is then
   loaded and executed on the machine to obtain the result. [From: `G.
   Üçoluk, S. Kalkan, Introduction to Programming Concepts with Case
   Studies in Python, Springer,
   2012 <https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-7091-1343-1>`__]



2. **Interpretive Approach**. In this approach, a machine code program,
   named as *interpreter*, when run, inputs and processes the high-level
   program line by line (:numref:`fig_ch2_interpreter`). After taking
   a line as input, the actions described in the line are *immediately*
   executed; if the action is printing some value, the output is printed
   right away; if it is an evaluation of a mathematical expression, all
   values are substituted and at that very point-in-time, the expression
   is evaluated to calculate the result. In other words, any action is
   carried out immediately when the interpreter comes to its line in the
   program. In practice, it is always possible to write down the program
   lines into a file, and make the interpreter read the program lines
   one by one from that file as well.

.. _fig_ch2_interpreter:

.. figure:: ../figures/ch2_interpreter.png
   :width: 500px

   Interpreted languages (e.g. Python) come with interpreters that
   process and evaluate each action (statement) from the user on the run
   and returns an answer. [From: `G. Üçoluk, S. Kalkan, Introduction to
   Programming Concepts with Case Studies in Python, Springer,
   2012 <https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-7091-1343-1>`__]



**Which approach is better?**

Both approaches have their benefits. When a specific task is considered,
compilers generate fast executing machine codes compared to the same
task being carried out by an interpreter. On the other hand compilers
are unpleasant when trial-and-errors are possible during the task
realization. Interpreters, on the other hand, allow making small changes
and the programmer receives immediate responses, which makes it easier
to observe intermediate results and adjust the algorithm accordingly.
However, interpreters are slower since they involve an interpretation
component while running the code. Sometimes this slowness is by a factor
of 20. Therefore, the interpretive approach is good for quick
implementations whereas using a compiler is good for computation intense
big projects or time-tight tasks.

Programming-language Paradigms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As we mentioned before, there are more than 700 programming languages.
Certainly some are for academic purposes and some did not gain any
popularity. But there are about 20 programming languages which are
commonly used for writing programs. How do we choose one?

Picking a particular programming language is not just a matter of taste.
During the course of the evolution of the programing languages,
different strategies or world views about programming have also
developed. These world views are reflected in the programming languages.
For example, one world view regards the programming task as transforming
some initial data (the initial information that defines the problem)
into a final form (the data that is the answer to that problem) by
applying a sequence of functions. From this perspective, writing a
program consists of defining some functions which are then used in a
functional composition; a composition which, when applied to some
initial data, yields the answer to the problem.

This concept of world views are coined as *programming paradigms*. The
Oxford dictionary defines the word paradigm as follows:

   **paradigm** :math:`|`\ ’parǝ,dïm\ :math:`|`

   *noun*

   A world view underlying the theories and methodology of a particular
   scientific subject.

Below is a list of some major paradigms:

-  **Imperative**: Is a paradigm where programming statements and their
   composition directly map to the machine code segments, so that the
   whole machine code is covered.

-  **Functional**: In this paradigm, solving a programming task is to
   construct a group of functions so that their ‘functional composition’
   acting on the initial data produces the solution.

-  **Object oriented**: In this paradigm the compulsory separation (due
   to the von Neumann architecture) of algorithm from data is lifted,
   and algorithm and data are reunited under an artificial computational
   entity: *the object*. An object has algorithmic properties as well as
   data properties.

-  **Logical-declarative**: This is the most contrasting view compared
   to the imperative paradigm. The idea is to represent logical and
   mathematical relations among entities (as rules) and then ask an
   inference engine for a solution that satisfies all rules. The
   inference engine is a kind of ‘prover’, i.e. a program, that is
   constructed by the inventor of the logical-declarative programming
   language.

-  **Concurrent**: A paradigm where independent computational entities
   work towards the solution of a problem. For problems that can be
   solved by a divide-and-concure strategy this paradigm is very
   suitable.

-  **Event driven**: This paradigm considers a world of events into
   programming. Events are assumed to be asynchronous and they have
   ‘handlers’, i.e. programs that carry out the actions associated with
   that particular event. Programming graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
   is usually performed using event-driven languages: An event in a GUI
   is generated e.g. when the user clicks the “Close” button, which
   triggers the execution of a handler function that performs the
   associated closing action.

In contrary to the layman programmers’ assumption, these paradigms are
not mutually exclusive. Many paradigms can very well co-exist in a
programming language together. At a meta level, we can call them
‘orthogonal’ to each other. This is why we have so many programming
languages around. A language can provide imperative as well as
functional and object-oriented constructs. Then it is up to the
programmer to blend them in his or her particular program. As it is with
many ‘world views’ among humans, in the field of programming, fanaticism
exists too. You can meet individuals that do only functional programming
or object-oriented programming. We better consider them outliers.

Python, the subject language of this book, supports strongly the
imperative, functional and object-orient paradigms. It also provides
some functionality in other paradigms by some modules.

-  Assume that we have a parser than can process and parse natural
   language descriptions (without any syntactic restrictions) for
   programming a computer. Given such a parser, do you think we would
   use natural language to program computers? If no, why not?

-  For each situation below, try to identify which paradigm is more
   suitable compared to the others:

-  Writing a program which should take an image as input, an RGB color
   value and find all pixels in the image that match the given color.

-  Writing a theorem proving program.

-  Writing the auto pilot program flying an airplane.

-  Writing a document editing program as an alternative to Microsoft
   Word.
