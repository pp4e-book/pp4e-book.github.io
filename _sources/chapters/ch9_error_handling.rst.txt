As Turkish song says “*There is no servant without fault, love me with
the faults I have*”, we all make mistakes and programming is far from
being an exception to this. It is a highly technical, error-intolerant
task requiring full attention from the programmer. Even a single letter
you mistype can produce in complete opposite of what you aim to get. The
history of computing is full of examples on large of amounts of money
wasted on small programming mistakes (banks losing millions due to penny
roundings, satellites turning into most expensive fireworks, robots
bricked on Mars surface etc). Even worse, lives of some people can
depend on proper functioning of a program.

For this reason, writing programs as error free as possible is an
important challenge and responsibility for a programmer. Programming
errors can be classified in three groups:

1. Syntax errors
2. Run-time errors
3. Logical errors

Types of Errors
---------------

Syntax Errors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Syntax errors are due to strict wellformedness requirements of
programming languages. In a natural language essay, we can use no
punctuation at all, we can use silly abbreviations, mix the ordering of
words, make typing mistakes and still it will make sense to a reader
(though your English teacher might reduce some points).

Computer programs are entirely different. When a programming language
specification tells you to define blocks based on indentation, to match
parentheses properly, to follow certain statements with some certain
punctuation (i.e. loops and functions and ``:``), you have to obey that.
Because our compilers and interpreters cannot convert a program with
syntax errors into a machine understandable form.

The first step of the Python interpreter reading your program is to
break it up into parts and construct a machine-readable structure out of
it. If it fails, you will get a syntax error, for example:

.. code:: python

   >>> for i in range(10)
   ...    print(i)

   File "<ipython-input-1-12d72cac235a>", line 1
       for i in range(10)
                         ^
   SyntaxError: invalid syntax

.. code:: python

   >>> x = float(input())
   >>> a = ((x+5)*12+4

   File "<ipython-input-2-dead5b360d91>", line 2
     a = ((x+5)*12+4
                    ^
   SyntaxError: invalid syntax

.. code:: python

   >>> s = 0
   >>> for i in range(10):
   ...  s += i
   ...    print(i)

   File "<ipython-input-3-c3ef5d622e47>", line 4
     print(i)
     ^
   IndentationError: unexpected indent

.. code:: python

   >>> while x = 4:
   ...    s += x

   File "<ipython-input-4-befcf7769cec>", line 1
     while x = 4:
             ^
   SyntaxError: invalid syntax

In the examples above, syntax errors are:

1. ``:`` is missing at the end of the ``for`` loop.

2. The first parenthesis does not have a matching closing parenthesis.

3. Different indentation levels are used in the loop body.

4. ``while`` expects a boolean expression but an assignment is given
   (``=`` is used instead of ``==``).

These are only a small sample of large number of possible syntax errors
one can do.

Syntax errors are the most innocent errors since you are notified of the
error immediately when you start running your program. Running your
program once will give you the exact spot (though, sometimes parentheses
and quote matching can be non-trivial) in the error output. If you have
learnt the syntax of your language, you can fix it with a small effort.

Type errors
~~~~~~~~~~~

Python is an interpreted language and it does not make strict type
checks like a compiler would check type compatibility at compile time.
Though, when it comes to performing an operation that is not compatible
with the current type of a variable/data, Python will complain. For
example, when you try to override a string element with an integer
value, use an integer on a string context, select an element out of a
float variables etc., you will get an error:

.. code:: python

   astr = 'hello'
   bflt = 4.56
   cdict = {'a':4, 'b':5}

   print(astr ** 3)       # second power of a string
   print(bflt[1])         # select first member of a float
   print(cdict * 2)       # multiply a dictionary by two
   cdict < astr           # compare a dictionary with a string

These will lead to the following errors:

.. code:: python

   >>> print(astr ** 3)
   Traceback (most recent call last):
     File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
   TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for ** or pow(): 'str' and 'int'
   >>> print(bflt[1])
   Traceback (most recent call last):
     File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
   TypeError: 'float' object is not subscriptable
   >>> print(cdict * 2)
   Traceback (most recent call last):
     File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
   TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'dict' and 'int'
   >>> cdict < astr
   Traceback (most recent call last):
     File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
   TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'dict' and 'str'

Compiled languages and some interpreters enforce type compatibility at
compile time and treat all such errors as if they are syntax errors,
providing a safer programming experience at run time. However, Python
and most other interpreters wait until command is first executed and
raise the error at the execution time, causing a **run-time error**.

Run-Time Errors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run-time errors are more sneaky compared to syntax and other
compile-time errors. Your program starts to execute silently, visit many
loops and functions without an error, produce some intermediate output,
and suddenly, in the most unexpected moment, it raises an error and you
get a disappointing error text instead of the decent result output that
you expected.

The following example gets an input value and counts how many of the
integers in the range :math:`[1, 1000]` are divisible by the input
value.

.. code:: python

   def divisible(m, n):
     return m % n == 0

   def count(m):
     sum = 0
     for i in range(1,1000):
       if divisible(i, m):
         sum += 1

     return sum

   value = int(input())
   print('input value is:', value)
   print(value,' divides ', count(value), ' many integers in range [1, 1000]')

It works without any problem for non-zero input values. However if you
enter ``0``, it outputs:

.. figure:: ../figures/ch9_traceback.png
   :width: 800px

   A traceback example.


This output is called error **Traceback**. When a run-time error occurs,
you will get one of these and the execution of the program will be
terminated. Depending on the settings, the output may be more brief but
you will get line numbers and the line leading to the error.

The reason for this example error is called an **Exception** and colored
red in the above output. It is given in the first line and repeated with
explanation in the last line. Traceback also reports the functions
involving the error, from the outermost to the innermost. Each arrow
(colored green) marks the program line causing the error. The last item
in the traceback is the actual position where the error occurred; the
2\ :math:`^{nd}` line having ``return m % n == 0`` in this case. The
``divisible()`` function containing the error line is called by the
7\ :math:`^{th}` line, the ``count()`` function, which is called by
14\ :math:`^{th}` line of the program. By looking at the error output,
you will see the whole chain of calls that lead your program to the
error state. The last one is the most important one, where Python tried
to execute an operation and failed.

The reason for failure is ``ZeroDivisionError`` in this case. If you
trace the program with input value 0, you will see that Python tried to
evaluated ``m % 0 == 0`` for some ``m`` value. The remainder operator is
division based and dividing something by 0 is impossible mathematically.
All programming languages reject this operation by a run-time error, and
this is the Python style.

The following are the most common exceptions and run-time errors in
Python:

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Exception                         | Reason                            |
+===================================+===================================+
| **KeyboardInterrupt**             | User presses ``Ctrl-C``; not an   |
|                                   | error but user intervention       |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| **ZeroDivisionError**             | Right-hand side of ``/`` or ``%`` |
|                                   | is 0                              |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| **EOFError**                      | ``input()`` function gets         |
|                                   | End-of-Input by user              |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| **IndexError**                    | Container index is not valid      |
|                                   | (negative or larger than length)  |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| **KeyError**                      | ``dict`` has no such key          |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| **FileNotFoundError**             | The target file of ``open()``     |
|                                   | does not exist                    |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| **TypeError**                     | Wrong operand or parameter types, |
|                                   | or wrong number of parameters for |
|                                   | functions                         |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| **ValueError**                    | The given value has correct type  |
|                                   | but the operation is not          |
|                                   | supported for the given value     |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

The following code illustrates each of these errors (except for the
user-generated ones):

.. code:: python

   b = 0
   a = a / b                # ZeroDivisionError

   x = [1,2,3]
   print(x.length)          # AttributeError: lists does not have a length attribute (use len(x))

   print(x[4])              # IndexError: last valid index of list x is 2

   person = { 'name' : 'Han', 'surname': 'Solo'}
   print(person['Name'])    # KeyError: person does not have 'Name' key but 'name'

   fp = open("example.txt") # FileNotFoundError: file "example.txt" does not exist

   print([1,2,3] / 12)      # TypeError: Division is not defined for lists

   def f(x, y):
     return x*x+y

   print(f(5))              # TypeError: Only one element is supplied instead of 2.
    
   print(int('thirtytwo'))  # ValueError: string value does not represent an integer
    
   a,b,c = [1,2,3,4]        # ValueError: too many values on the right hand side

Logical Errors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the worst among all errors because Python does not raise an
error. It single-mindedly keeps running your program; however, your
program has a mistake about what it intends to compute. In other words,
it simply does not do what it is supposed to do because of an error.

Such an error can be due to a small typo, improper nesting of blocks,
bad initialization of variables, and many other reasons. However, the
code segment containing the error has correct syntax and hence, it does
not cause a run-time error. As a result, you will not know such an error
exists until you see some problems in your output.

The following are a few examples for logical errors:

.. code:: python

   y = x / x+1             # you meant y = x / (x+1), forgetting about precedence

   lastresult = 0
   def missglobal(x):                           
     result = x*x+1                  # you intend to update the global variable
     if lastresult != result:        # but you assign a local variable instead
       lastresult = result           # you should have used "global lastresult"


   def returnsnothing(x, y):
     y = x*x+y*y
     if x <= y:
       return x                      # if x > y, the function returns nothing
   print(returnsnothing(0.1, 0.1))   # does not have any value. prints "None"

   s = 1
   while i < n:                      # you forgot incrementing i as i+=1
      s += s*x/i                     # loop will run forever. "infinite loop"

How to Work with Errors
-----------------------

Errors are unavoidable in programming. As you get experience, they will
decrease but they will still be there. Fortunately, we have methods to
have less errors but completely getting rid of them is not possible.

The following is a list of strategies for eliminating errors:

1. Program with care
2. Place controls in your code
3. Handle exceptions
4. Write verification code and raise exceptions
5. Debug your program
6. Write test cases

Those strategies can be applied by programmers with different experience
levels. In the extreme case, assuring quality of programs and software
testing are important professions of the software engineering discipline
and handled by dedicated engineers.

Program with Care
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best way to write error-free programs is not to cause one in the
first place. Instead of cleaning your living room every day, you may
just choose not to throw garbage around. Programming is similar, the
great percentage of errors are due to the careless acts of a programmer.

Programming is **not** an evolutionary process where you start from an
ugly code and make it better and better as you correct errors. This way
of programming is possible but not efficient. You better spend some time
before starting to write code to to design your solution and develop a
strategy: which functions you need, which data structures you use, which
algorithms you use, and which order you will write the code. It is a
good practice to divide your problem into pieces (functions for
example). Write one function at a time and test it before going into the
next step.

This strategy will get better as you become a more experienced
programmer but nothing stops you from paying more attention on your
first day of coding.

Place Controls in Your Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The values that a variable can have or a function may return are not
known in advance. Especially, what input user may provide is completely
untrustable. Also, there are other environmental issues like existence
of a file.

If you have such an untrustable value, the next operation may fail as a
result of it like:

.. code:: python

   a = [1,2,3]
   age = {'Han': 30, 'Leia': 20, 'Luke': 20}

   # CASE 1
   n = int(input())
   print(a[n])          # will fail for n > 2 or n < -2

   # CASE 2
   name = input()
   print(age[name])     # will fail names other than 'Han', 'Leia', 'Luke'

   # CASE 3
   x = float(input())
   y = math.sqrt(x)     # will fail for x < 0
   y = 1 / x            # will fail for x == 0

In order to deal with such errors, you can check all values, especially
user supplied ones. Checking all input values before starting a
computation is called **Input Sanitization**.

.. code:: python

   # CASE 1 with sanitization
   n = int(input())
   if 0 <= n < len(a):
     print(a[n])        
   else:
     print("n is not valid:", n)

   # CASE 2 with sanitization
   name = input()
   if name in age:      # membership test for dictionaries
     print(age[name])
   else:
     print("dictionary does not have member:", name)

   # CASE 3 with sanitization
   x = float(input())
   if x >= 0:
     y = math.sqrt(x)   
   else:
     print("invalid for sqrt operation: ", x)

   if x != 0:
     y = 1 / x
   else:
     print("divisor cannot be 0")

Writing such conditions look like a tedious job at first, but dealing
with them while your program is running is much worse for users. If you
are writing a program that will be really useful, you have to do these
types of input checks.

Handle Exceptions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is an alternative to putting check conditions in your code.
Sometimes there are too many conditions, one for each step of your
computation, so that each line of code opens a new ``if`` block and
nests like the branches of a tree. Instead of writing whole
nested-sequence of ``if ... else`` statements, exceptions give you a
chance to handle all errros in the same place. Especially, they allow
you to handle the errors in the caller function rather than the original
place where error occurred. Before we can see how this works, we have to
learn a new syntax first:

.. code:: python

   try:
     ......    # a block with possible errors
     ......    # if there are function calls here
     ......    # and error occurs in the function, we can handle error here
   except exceptionname:     # exceptionname is optional
     .....     # this is error handling block.
     .....     # when there is an error, execution jumps here

This ``try-except`` block has two parts: A group of code (after
``try:``) that possibly generates run-time errors and a second or more
blocks to handle the errors. When the first error occurs in the ``try``
part, the execution jumps to the ``except`` part. If ``except`` part
matches the corresponding block, it is executed. Multiple ``except``
blocks are allowed for different kinds of exceptions. ``except :``,
without an exception name, matches all errors and can be used to handle
all of them one block.

The following is the same example in the previous section, but errors
are handled in the same place.

.. code:: python

    import math
    
    a = [1,2,3]
    age = {'Han': 30, 'Leia': 20, 'Luke': 20}
    
    try:
      n = int(input())
      print(a[n])          # will fail for n > 2 or n < -2
    
      name = input()
      print(age[name])     # will fail names other than 'Han', 'Leia', 'Luke'
    
      x = float(input())
      y = math.sqrt(x)     # will fail for x < 0
      y = 1 / x            # will fail for x == 0
    except IndexError:
      print('List index is not valid')
    except KeyError:
      print('Dictionary does not have such key')
    except ValueError:
      print('Invalid value for square root operation')
    except ZeroDivisionError:
      print('Division by zero does not have value')
    except:
      print('None of the known errors. Something happened even if nothing happened')


.. parsed-literal::
    :class: output

    None of the known errors. Something happened even if nothing happened


You can try the above example with different inputs:

1. ``-1``
2. ``2 'Obi'``
3. ``2 'Han' -2``
4. ``2 'Han' 0``
5. ``2 'Han' 1``

The first will have ``a[n]`` raise an ``IndexError``. The second will
have ``age[name]`` raise a ``KeyError``. The third will have ``sqrt(x)``
raise a ``ValueError``. The fourth will have ``1 / x`` raise a
``ZeroDivisionError``. The last one will have no error and finish the
``try`` block and continue with the next instruction jumping over
``except`` blocks. You can also create exceptions with ``raise``
statement. ``raise ValueError`` will create the error.

Exceptions save you from nested ``if .. else`` statements for data
validation, e.g.:

.. code:: python

   if cond1:
      ..1..
      if cond2:
        ..2..
        if cond3:
          ..3..
          ..4..       # success at last
        else:
          # report error
      else:
        # report error
   else:
     # report error

is harder to read compared to the following:

.. code:: python

   try:
     if !cond1:
       raise Error

     ..1..

     if !cond2:
       raise Error

     ..2..

     if !cond3:
       raise Error

     ..3..
     ..4..  # success
   except :
     ... Error handling

which is more flat and allows you to focus on the actual code.

Write verification code and raise exceptions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Even if you sanitize user input and check all arguments for valid
values, your program can still have logical errors and it might
calculate incorrect intermediate/final values. If your program consists
of multiple steps, a logical error in step one will cause step two to
calculate an incorrect value and this will create a *snowball effect*,
potentially causing all steps and the last to fail.

For example, you wrote a function for solving second-order equations
:math:`a x^2 + b x + c = 0`, named it ``solvesecond(a,b,c)`` which
returns ``(x1, x2)`` as the roots. You are (*almost*) sure that you
always send correct ``a,b,c`` values to this function. However, it won’t
hurt if you add a check like the following:

.. code:: python

   def solvesecond(a,b,c):
     det = b*b - 4*a*c
     # the following is the verification code
     if det < 0:
       print("Equation has no real roots for", a, b, c)
       raise ValueError
     ....
     ...

The ``math.sqrt`` function would have raised the exception anyway.
However, you add extra error message about what caused the problem.
Also, in logical errors, there is no run-time error and this error may
be as serious as finding imaginary roots.

Debug Your Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Finding the position and the cause of a programming error and fixing it
is called **debugging**. It involves pinpointing the position of the
error, reasons causing the error and updating the code so that it does
not cause the error any more.

Debugging methods are explained in detail in its own section below.

Write Test Cases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to make sure your program is working properly, in other words,
it contains no logical errors, you need to test it. Testing is an
important yet non-trivial part of all engineering disciplines.

In order to test a program, you should create a set of inputs, run your
program for each input case and collect the outputs. If there is a way
of verifying the outputs, you can verify them. For example, if you solve
an equation, you substitute the found variable in the equation to test
if it holds:

.. code:: python

   (x1, x2) = findrootsecond(a,b,c)

   if a*x1*x1 + b*x1 + c != 0 or a*x2*X2 + b*x2 +c != 0:
      print('test failed for', a, b, c, 'roots', x1, x2)

You can generate millions of such numbers and automatically verify them.

If the problem is not verifiable, you can get a set of known solutions
and compare your solutions against the known solutions.

Debugging
---------

Debugging is an act of looking for errors in a code, finding what causes
the errors and correcting them. As even the modest programs can go as
large as hundreds of lines of code, debugging is not an easy task. Even
if a run-time error gives you the exact location of the error, the
variable value causing the error can be owing to a different place in
your code and you will not get the variable state of the program at the
moment.

Debugging is an iterative activity. You divide your program into parts
and eliminate each part one by one, ruling out the error: Narrow down
all possibilities step by step to find the exact step where you made the
mistake. Run-time errors help you speed-up this process.

There are several methods for debugging. A programmer may use one or
more of them for debugging.

The following is a sample program with an error (you may check the Colab
link and run this interactive example):

.. code:: python

   def startswith(srcstr, tarstr):
       '''check if tarstr starts with srcstr
         like srcstr="abra" tarstr="abracadabra" '''
       for i in range(len(srcstr)): # check all characters of srcstr
           if srcstr[i] != tarstr[i]:  # if does not match return False
               return False
       return True   # if False is not returned yet, it matches


   def findstr(srcstr, tarstr):
       '''Find position of srcstr in tarstr'''
       for i in range(len(tarstr)):
           # if scrstr is same as tarstr from i to rest
           # return i
           if startswith(srcstr, tarstr[i:]):     
                   return i
       return -1

   IndexError: string index out of range

The first call returns 5, which is printed on screen, telling us that
``"ada"`` is at position 5 of ``"abracadabra"``, matches after
``"abrac"``. However, the second call should return ``-1`` since the
``"aba"`` substring does not exist in ``"abracadabra"`` but it generates
an error.

Debugging Using Debugging Outputs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is one of the simplest, oldest but still an effective method for
debugging a program. In this method, you add extra output lines that
shed light on the behaviour of your program. This way, you can trace
where your program diverted from the expected behaviour. For example
(you may check the Colab link and run this interactive example):

.. code:: python

   def startswith(srcstr, tarstr):
       '''check if tarstr starts with srcstr
         like srcstr="abra" tarstr="abracadabra" '''
       for i in range(len(srcstr)): # check all characters of srcstr
           print("check if ", srcstr, '!=', tarstr, 'for i=', i)
           if srcstr[i] != tarstr[i]:  # if does not match return False
               return False
       return True   # if False is not returned yet, it matches


   def findstr(srcstr, tarstr):
       '''Find position of srcstr in tarstr'''
       for i in range(len(tarstr)):
           # if scrstr is same as tarstr from i to rest
           # return i
           print("calling startswith", srcstr, tarstr[i:])
           if startswith(srcstr, tarstr[i:]):     
                   return i
       return -1

   print(findstr("aba", "abracadabra"))

which outputs the following when run:

.. code:: python

         7             return False
         8     return True   # if False is not returned yet, it matches

   IndexError: string index out of range

In the output, you can see that execution failed after output
“``check if  aba != a for i= 1``”. Therefore, we can reason that an
error occurred at the next step. The following test is:

``if srcstr[i] != tarstr[i]`` for ``"aba"`` and ``"a"`` for ``i = 1``.

Apparently, getting ``tarstr[1]`` for ``tarstr == "a"`` fails since the
length of ``tarstr`` is 1 and the only valid index is 0. There are
different ways to get rid of this error. One quick solution is to test
if lengths of ``srcstr`` and ``tarstr`` are compatible as
``len(tarstr) >= len(srcstr)`` should hold in ``startswith``. The
programmer should have considered this and handled this case. Now, we
can correct it as a result of our debugging session.

Of course, debugging output should be added in the correct places with
sufficient descriptive information. If you add too much debugging
output, you may be lost in output lines. If there is not sufficient
output, you may not find the error.

For generic tracing of programs with multiple functions, you can use the
following Python magic called **decorator**, which reports all function
calls with parameters when a function is decorated as (you may check the
Colab link and run this interactive example):

.. code:: python

   def tracedec(f):
       def traced(*p, **kw):
           print('  ' * tracedec.level + "->", f.__name__,'(',p, kw,')')
           tracedec.level += 1
           val = f(*p, **kw)
           tracedec.level -= 1
           print('  ' * tracedec.level + "<-", f.__name__, 'returns ', val)
           return val
       return traced
   tracedec.level = 0

   @tracedec
   def startswith(srcstr, tarstr):
       '''check if tarstr starts with srcstr
         like srcstr="abra" tarstr="abracadabra" '''
       for i in range(len(srcstr)):    # check all characters of srcstr
           if srcstr[i] != tarstr[i]:  # if does not match, return False
               return False
       return True   # if False is not returned yet, it matches

   @tracedec
   def findstr(srcstr, tarstr):
       '''Find position of srcstr in tarstr'''
       for i in range(len(tarstr)):
           # if scrstr is same as tarstr from i to rest
           # return i
           if startswith(srcstr, tarstr[i:]):     
                   return i
       return -1

Putting ‘@tracedec’ before function definitions will give you the entry
and return states of these functions. How this decorator works and the
‘@’ syntax are far beyond the scope of this book. You may adapt and use
this example if it suits you.

Handle the Exception to Get More Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One problem with the run-time errors is that they do not give
information about the current state of the program, basically the set of
variables. They give the traceback which includes the line causing the
exception and how program came to that state (which functions are
active). In order to get the values of the variables, you can handle the
exception and add log output to the handler as follows (you may check
the Colab link and run this interactive example):

.. code:: python

   def startswith(srcstr, tarstr):
       '''check if tarstr starts with srcstr
         like srcstr="abra" tarstr="abracadabra" '''
       try:
         for i in range(len(srcstr)): # check all characters of srcstr
             if srcstr[i] != tarstr[i]:  # if does not match return False
                 return False
       except IndexError:
         print('Error: srcstr: ', srcstr, ', tarstr:', tarstr, ', i:',i)
         raise IndexError          # if you like, generate an additional exception
       return True   # if False is not returned yet, it matches

   def findstr(srcstr, tarstr):
       '''Find position of srcstr in tarstr'''
       for i in range(len(tarstr)):
           # if scrstr is same as tarstr from i to rest
           # return i
           if startswith(srcstr, tarstr[i:]):     
                   return i
       return -1

   findstr("aba", "abracadabra")

which outputs the following when run:

.. code:: python

   Error: srcstr:  aba , tarstr: a , i: 1
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   IndexError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
   <ipython-input-11-b4556283ff77> in startswith(srcstr, tarstr)
         5       for i in range(len(srcstr)): # check all characters of srcstr
   ----> 6           if srcstr[i] != tarstr[i]:  # if does not match return False
         7               return False

   IndexError: string index out of range

   During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

   IndexError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
   2 frames
   <ipython-input-11-b4556283ff77> in startswith(srcstr, tarstr)
         8     except IndexError:
         9       print('Error: srcstr: ',srcstr, ', tarstr:', tarstr, ', i:',i)
   ---> 10       raise IndexError          # if you like generate error again
        11     return True   # if False is not returned yet, it matches
        12

   IndexError:

This way, we get the output:

``Error: srcstr:  aba , tarstr: a , i: 1``

which gives us the state of the variables at the moment of the error.

Use Python Debugger
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All programming environments come with a **debugger software** which
helps a programmer to execute a program step by step, observe the
current state, add break-points (stops) to inspect, and provide a
controlled execution environment.

For compiled languages, debuggers are external programs getting user’s
program as input. For Python, it is a module called **pdb**, which
stands for *Python DeBugger*. If you use an integrated development
environment (IDE), a debugger is embedded in the tool so you can use it
via the graphical user interface controls. Otherwise, you can use the
command line interface.

In the command line, the only thing you need to do is to put:

.. code:: python

   import pdb

at the beginning of your program, and type:

.. code:: python

   pdb.set_trace()

at any place you like to stop execution and go into the **debugging
mode**\ \*. When you run your program or call a function, your program
will start executing and when the execution hits one of the trace
points, execution will stop and a debugger prompt (``(Pdb)``) will be
displayed:

.. code:: python

   > <ipython-input-14-110393975fb5>(7)startswith()
   -> for i in range(len(srcstr)): # check all characters of srcstr
   (Pdb) h

   Miscellaneous help topics:
   ==========================
   exec  pdb

The first line tells which function and line execution have been
stopped. When ``h`` or ``help`` is typed, the following help lines are
displayed. Single-two letter commands are abbreviated forms of the
longer ones (e.g. ``a`` for ``args``, ``b`` for ``break``, ``c`` for
``cont``, ``cl`` for ``clear``, …).

After this point, you can use ``next`` (``n``) to execute the program
line by line. If the current statement has a function call, you may
choose to go into the function call using the ``step`` (``s``) command.
Otherwise, ``next`` will call and return it in single step. During
debugging, ``print`` (``p``) command can be used to print content of a
variable. The following is a summary of the useful commands of the
debugger:

+---------------------+------------------------------------------------+

Debuggers are powerful tools especially when you have complex code
interacting with many modules and functions. However, you need time to
master and control it. The good news is if you use an integrated
development interface, they are easier to control.
