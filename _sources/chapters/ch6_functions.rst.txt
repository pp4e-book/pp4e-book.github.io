A *function* (or sometimes synonymously referred to as subroutine,
procedure or sub-program) is a grouping of actions under a given name
that performs a specific task. ``len()``, ``print()``, ``abs()``,
``type()`` are functions that we have seen before. Python adopts a
syntax that resembles mathematical functions.

A function, i.e. ‘named’ pieces of code, can receive parameters. These
parameters are variables that carry information from the “calling point”
(e.g. when you write ``N = len("The number of chars")``) to the callee,
i.e. the piece of code that *defined* the function (``len()`` in our
example). The life span of these variables (parameters) is as long as
the function is active (for that call).

Why define functions?
---------------------

There are four main reasons for using functions while developing
solutions with a programming language:

1- **Reusability**

A function is defined at a single point in a program but it can be
called from several different points. Assume you need to calculate the
run-length encoding of a string (the example code from the previous
chapter) in your program for :math:`n` different strings in different
positions of your code. In a programming language without functions, you
would have to copy-paste that code piece in :math:`n` different places.
Thanks to functions, we can place the code piece in a function once
(named ``encodeRunLen`` for example) and use it in :math:`n` places via
simple function calls like ``enc = encodeRunLen(inpstr)``.

If functions would not be present, even if we would have the piece of
code that does the actions of the function, how would we return to the
different calling points after the actions are completed? Something,
that is theoretically possible but extremely painful.

2- **Maintenance**

Using functions makes it easier to make updates to the algorithm. Let us
explain this with the run-length encoding example: Assume that we found
a bug in our calculation or we have discovered a better algorithm than
the one we are using. Without functions, you would need to go through
all your code, find the locations where your run-length encoding
algorithm is implemented, and update each and every one of them. This is
impractical and very tedious. With functions, it is sufficient if you
just change the function that implements the run-length encoding.

3- **Structuredness**

Let us have a look at a perfectly valid Python expression:

.. code:: python

   (b if b<c else c) if (a if a<b else b)<(b if b<c else c) else (a if a<b else b)

which certainly takes some time to parse and understand but it just
performs the following:

.. code:: python

   max(min(a,b), min(b,c))

Assume instead of the long expression above, the one with ``min`` and
``max`` are used. Even if the definition of ``max`` and ``min`` are not
given yet, still one can grasp what the expression is up to. It is not
only because the expression is smaller, but because function naming can
depict the meaning for the actions.

4- **Benefits of the functional programming paradigm**

If a programmer sticks to the functional paradigm, then he or she has to
plot a functional decomposition so that the solution of the problem is
obtained by means of functional composition, something that is
well-known and understood through Mathematics. This type of a solution
does not suffer from unexpected side effects or variable alterations;
therefore, testing and debugging are easier. Another benefit of the
functional paradigm is recursion: In other words, while defining a
function, we can call the function that is being defined – we will cover
this seemingly confusing concept below. Moreover, we can define
higher-order functions that take functions as input and apply them to a
sequence of data. All these benefits come free with using functions, as
we will illustrate below.

Even when we do not limit ourselves to ‘functional programming’, it is
essential to use functions in professional programming. General
algorithms that are coded as functions are becoming very valuable
because they can be reused again and again in new programs. Collections
formed by such general purpose functions are called *libraries*. For
almost all application areas libraries have been created over decades.

Defining functions
------------------

For defining a function, Python adopts the following syntax:

\ ``def``\  :math:`\boxed{\color{red}{FunctionName\strut}}` \ ``(``\ 
:math:`\boxed{\color{red}{Parameter_1\strut}}` \ ``,``\ 
:math:`\boxed{\color{red}{Parameter_2\strut}}` \ ``,``\ 
:math:`\color{red}{\large\cdots}` \ ``)``\  \ ``:``\ 
:math:`\boxed{\color{red}{Statement\strut\ }}`

The :math:`\color{red}{Statement}`, which can be replaced by multiple
statements like we did with other compound statements, can make use of
the :math:`\color{red}{Parameter_i}`\ s to obtain the actual arguments
sent to the function at call-time. If the function is going to give a
value in return to the call, this value is provided by a ``return``
statement.

:math:`\color{red}{FunctionName}` is the name of the function being
defined. Python follows the same naming rules and conventions used for
naming variables – if you do not remember them, we recommend you to go
back and check the restrictions for naming variables in Chapter 4.

Here is a straightforward example. Let us assume that we want to
implement the following function:

.. math::


   F_{gravity}(m_1,m_2,r) = G\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}.

The following is the one-line Python code that defines it:

.. code:: python

   def F_gravity(m_1, m_2, r): return G * m_1 * m_2 / (r * r)

This function, ``F_gravity``, returns a value. This is provided by the
``return`` statement. As you may have observed, the values :math:`m_1`,
:math:`m_2` and :math:`r` are provided as the first, the second and the
third parameters, named as ``m_1``, ``m_2`` and ``r``, respectively.

But what about ``G``? It is not provided in the arguments and used in
the return expression for its value. If the definition were a
multi-statement definition (indented multi-statements following the
``def`` line), then Python would seek for a defined value for ``G``
among them. But this is not even the case, so the last alternative is to
seek a value in the ``global`` environment, the environment in which
``F_gravity`` is called.

Therefore, before we call ``F_gravity``, we must make sure that a value
for a global variable ``G`` (which apparently is the *Gravitational
Constant*) is set. In the **Scope of Variables** section, we will be
handling the rules of this to a greater extent.

.. code:: python

    def F_gravity(m1, m2, r): return G * m1 * m2 / (r * r)
    
    G = 6.67408E-11
    print(F_gravity(1000, 20, 0.5), "Newton")


.. parsed-literal::
    :class: output

    5.3392640000000006e-06 Newton


Passing parameters to functions
-------------------------------

When a function is called, first its arguments are evaluated. The
function will receive the results of these evaluations. The parameter
variables used in the definition are created, and set to the result of
the argument evaluations. Then the statement that follows the column
(``:``) after the argument parenthesis is executed. Certainly this
statement can and will make use of the parameter variables (which are
set to the result of the argument evaluations).

Let us look at an example:

.. code:: python

    def F_gravity(m_1, m_2, r): return G * m_1 * m_2 / (r * r)
    
    G = 6.67408E-11
    
    S = 100
    Q = 2000
    
    print(F_gravity(Q+S, Q-S, ((504.3-66.1)**2+(351.1-7.7)**2)**0.5))


.. parsed-literal::
    :class: output

    8.59177215925003e-10


This is a legitimate piece of code that performs the following in order:

-  Defines the function ``F_gravity``.

-  Sets the value of the global variable ``G`` and ``S`` and ``Q``

-  Calls the (internally defined) ``print`` function which receives one
   argument. This argument is a function call to ``F_gravity``. So, in
   order to have a value to print, this function call has to be
   performed.

-  A call to ``F_gravity`` is prepared: It has three arguments, each has
   to be evaluated and boiled down to a value. So, in a left-to-right
   order the arguments are evaluated:

   -  ``Q+S``\ is evaluated, and the result is stored into ``m_1``.
   -  ``Q-S``\ is evaluated, and the result is stored into ``m_2``.
   -  Euclidean distance,
      :math:`\scriptstyle\mathtt{\sqrt{(504.3-66.1)^2+(351.1-7.7)^2}}`,
      is evaluated and the result is stored into ``r``.

-  Since all arguments are evaluated, the statement defining the
   function ``F_gravity`` can be executed.

-  This statement is ``return G * m_1 * m_2 / (r * r)``, which requires
   the expression following the ``return`` keyword to be evaluated and
   the result to be returned as the result of the function call.

-  Now the ``print`` function has got its parameter evaluated. The
   defining action of the ``print`` function can be carried out (This is
   an internally defined function, i.e. we cannot see its definition,
   but the documents defining the language explain it).

The bottom line is: Before the function is called, there is a
preparation phase where all arguments are evaluated and hence converted
to a value. This has a name in computer science and is coined as
*Call-by-value*.

Default Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While defining a function, we can provide default values to parameters
as follows:

\ ``def``\  :math:`\boxed{\color{red}{FunctionName\strut}}` \ ``(``\ 
:math:`\boxed{\color{red}{Parameter_1\strut}=\color{red}{Exp_1}}`
\ ``,``\ 
:math:`\boxed{\color{red}{Parameter_2\strut}=\color{red}{Exp_2}}`
\ ``,``\  :math:`\color{red}{\large\cdots}` \ ``)``\  \ ``:``\ 
:math:`\boxed{\color{red}{Statement\strut\ }}`

where :math:`\color{red}{Exp_i}` is an expression. When calling the
function, we may omit providing the parameters for which the function
has default values.

Let us have a look at a simple example:

.. code:: python

    def norm(x1, x2, norm_type="L1", verbose=True):
      result = None
      if norm_type == "L1": result = abs(x1) + abs(x2)
      elif norm_type == "L2": result = (x1**2 + x2**2)**0.5
      elif verbose: print("Norm not known:", norm_type)
    
      if verbose: print(f"The {norm_type} norm of", [x1, x2], "is:", result)
      return result
    
    norm(3, 4)                                      # CASE 1
    norm(3, 4, "L2")                                # CASE 2
    norm(3, 4, norm_type="L2")                      # CASE 3
    norm(3, 4, verbose=False)                       # CASE 4: Does not print the value
    norm(3, 4, verbose=True, norm_type="L1")        # CASE 5
    norm(x2=3, x1=4, verbose=True, norm_type="L1")  # CASE 6


.. parsed-literal::
    :class: output

    The L1 norm of [3, 4] is: 7
    The L2 norm of [3, 4] is: 5.0
    The L2 norm of [3, 4] is: 5.0
    The L1 norm of [3, 4] is: 7
    The L1 norm of [4, 3] is: 7




.. parsed-literal::
    :class: output

    7



.. code:: python

   # Let us look at some cases that lead to errors:
   >>> norm(3, 4, norm_type="L1", True)                # CASE 7
   File "<ipython-input-19-128dc3e43256>", line 2
       norm(3, 4, norm_type="L1", True)                # CASE 7
                                 ^
   SyntaxError: positional argument follows keyword argument

In this example, you should notice the following crucial points:

-  We can call a function without providing any value for the parameters
   that have default values (``CASE 1``, .., ``CASE 4``).

-  We can swap the order of default parameters when we are calling the
   function (``CASE 5`` and ``CASE 6``).

-  When calling a function, we can give values to non-default parameters
   by using their names (``CASE 6``).

-  The parameters after the default parameters need to be given names as
   well, both while defining the function and calling the function
   (``CASE 7``).

Scope of variables
------------------

We extensively use variables while programming our solutions. Not all
variables are accessible from everywhere. There is a governing set of
rules for that determine which parts of a code can access a variable.
The code part from which a variable is accessible is called its *scope*.

In Python, there are four categories of scopes. As will be explained
shortly, they are abbreviated with their initials , which then combine
to form the rule mnemonic LEGB standing for:

.. raw:: html

   <center>

[:math:`\color{red}{L}`\ ocal :math:`<` :math:`\color{red}{E}`\ nclosing
:math:`<` :math:`\color{red}{G}`\ lobal :math:`<`
:math:`\color{red}{B}`\ uilt-in]

.. raw:: html

   </center>

**1- Local Scope**

Defining a variable in a function in Python makes it local.

Local variables are the most ‘private’ ones. Any code which is external
to that function cannot see it. If you make an assignment anywhere in
the function to a variable, it is registered as a local variable. If you
attempt to refer to such a local variable prior to the assignment,
Python will generate a run-time error.

The local variables are created each time the function is called (it is
activated) and are annihilated (destructed) the moment the function
returns (finishes).

**2- Enclosing Scope**

As we mentioned before, it is possible to define functions inside
functions. They are coined as *local functions* and can refer (but not
change) to the values of the local variables of its parent function (the
function in which the local function is defined). The scope of the outer
function is the enclosing scope for the inner function. Though the
parent function’s variables are visible to the local function, the
converse is not true. The parent function cannot access its local
function’s local variables. Therefore, the accessibility is from inward
to outward and for referring purposes only.

**3- Global Scope**

If a variable is not defined in a function then it is a *global
variable*. It can be accessed outside as well as inside of any function.
If a global variable is accessed inside a function, it cannot be altered
there. If it is altered anywhere in the function, this is recognised at
the declaration-time and that variable is declared (created) as a local
variable. A local variable that has the same name with a global variable
conceals the global variable.

If you want to change the value of a global variable inside a function,
then you have to explicitly declare it as a global variable by a
statement:

\ ``global``\  :math:`\boxed{\color{red}{V\!ariable\strut}}`

Then an assignment to :math:`\color{red}{V\!ariable}` will not register
it as a local variable but merely refer to the global
:math:`\color{red}{V\!ariable}`. As said, since the system will
recognize them automatically, there is no need to use the ``global``
statement for global variables which are referred to for their values
only. However, it is a good programming habit to do so in order to
enhance readability and prevent accidental local variable creations (due
to careless assignments to global variables).

**4- Built-in Scope**

Built-in scope is a special Python scope that is created or loaded
whenever you run a script or open an interactive session. This is
actually the scope in which the Python interpreter starts. It contains
names such as keywords, built-in functions, exceptions, and some other
attributes. Entities in this scope are also available from everywhere in
your code.

**An Interactive Example for Scope**

Please follow the Colab link at the top of the page for an interactive
demo on scope of variables.

A variable occurrence has different meanings for different positions in
the program:

1. First time occurrence of the variable at the left-hand side of an
   assignment: This tells Python to declare a variable in the current
   scope, the current function or the global scope. If there is a
   variable with the same name in an outer scope, it is hidden as long
   as the new variable is active. This declaration will be active for
   the scope it is created in including statements preceding it.

2. Second and later occurrences of the variable at the left-hand side of
   an assignment: They simply update the previously declared variable.

3. Occurrences of the variable at the right-hand side of an assignment
   or any other place in an expression: Python places value (content) of
   the variable in the expression position. Variable is searched in all
   scopes from inner to outer (local, then enclosing, then global, then
   built-in) and the first found variable is used. If the declaration of
   the variable is after its reference in current scope, Python will
   raise the error ``'Reference before assignment'``.

Note that ``global`` declaration changes the behaviour above. It makes
all occurrences to refer to the global variable and does not declare a
variable in the current scope with the globally defined names.

Higher-order functions
----------------------

Python provides several flavours of the functional paradigm, one of the
most powerful of which is the ability to easily pass functions as
parameters to other functions. No special syntax or rule is used for
this: If you use a parameter as if it is a function and when calling the
higher-order function, pass a function name as a parameter, Python will
handle the rest.

Python provides two very practical higher-order functions for us:

-  **map** function: The ``map`` function has the following syntax:

   ``map(function, Iterator)``

   which yields an iterator where each element is ``function`` being
   applied on the corresponding element in ``Iterator``. Here is a
   simple example:

   .. code:: python

      >>> abs_it = map(abs, [10, -4, 20, -100])
      >>> for x in abs_it: print(x)
      10
      4
      20
      100

-  **filter** function: The ``filter`` function has a similar syntax to
   the ``map`` function:

   ``filter(predicate, Iterator)``

   where ``predicate`` is a function with a boolean return value. The
   ``filter`` function applies ``predicate`` to each element of the
   ``Iterator`` and only keeps the ones for which ``predicate`` returns
   ``True``. For example:

   .. code:: python

      >>> def positive(x): return x > 0
      >>> for x in filter(positive, [10, -4, 20, -100]): print(x)
      10
      20

Of course, the functional capabilities of Python is more diverse than we
can cover in this introductory textbook. The reader is referred to
`Python docs <https://docs.python.org/3/howto/functional.html>`__. The
curious reader is especially recommended to look at *lambda expressions*
and the *reduce* function.

Functions in programming vs. functions in Mathematics
-----------------------------------------------------

It is to be noted that functions have a differentiated meaning compared
to functions in Mathematics.

-  In Mathematics, a function is a mapping from a domain to a range
   (target); a function returns a value.

   \ **In Python:** Functions may not return a value at all. If so, they
   are intended to code a parametrized action. A few examples to this
   are:

   -  Drawing a :math:`red` line from :math:`(x_0, y_0)` to
      :math:`(x_1, y_1)`.
   -  Printing a separating line made of :math:`n` ‘minus’ signs.
   -  Turning off the lights.
   -  Sending a digital initialization string to a device connected
      through the USB port.

-  In Mathematics, a function definition is global. You do not have
   function definitions local to some function.

   \ **In Python:** Since a function definition is done by a Python
   :math:`\color{red}{Statement}` (or a group of statements – grouped by
   indentation), it is quite possible to have another definition as part
   of the defining statements. Such a function can only be usable in the
   :math:`\color{red}{Statement}` group that defines the outer function
   and access its local variables and parameters. Outside of the
   function, this interior function (called a *local function*) will not
   be visible nor usable.

-  In Mathematics, an element from the domain is mapped to one and only
   one target element by the function. The mapping does not change.
   Moreover, a mathematical function returns a value that only depends
   on the arguments. Hence, for the same arguments, the result is the
   same.

   \ **In Python:** Even if such a mapping exists (i.e. a function
   returns a value), it is possible that the function acts differently
   due to different settings of the variables (outside of the function)
   that can be accessed in the functions. Consider the ``F_gravity``
   function above: A different setting for the ``G`` (the Gravitational
   Constant) will yield a different ``F_gravity`` result even when the
   parameters are the same.

-  In Mathematics, a function’s operation is reflected on the value it
   returns: It does not have side effects. In other words, a
   mathematical function does not change the mathematical environment
   that is external to it (variables or the ways other functions are
   evaluated).

   \ **In Python:** This may not be true. Consider the ``G`` value of
   the ``F_gravity`` function above. Hypothetically, it is possible
   that, at each call of ``F_gravity``, the ``G`` value is increased
   slightly (1% for example):

.. code:: python

   >>> def F_gravity(m1, m2, r):
   ...   global G        # since we alter it
   ...   G = 1.01 * G
   ...   return G * m1 * m2 / (r * r)

   >>> G = 6.67408E-11

   >>> print(F_gravity(1000, 20, 0.5), "Newton")
   5.39265664e-06 Newton

   >>> print(F_gravity(1000, 20, 0.5), "Newton")
   5.4465832064e-06 Newton

   >>> print(F_gravity(1000, 20, 0.5), "Newton")
   5.501049038464e-06 Newton

In these aspects, a function defined in Python has a greater freedom. As
previously stated, there are paradigms of programming. One of these
paradigms, the *functional paradigm*, promotes the function’s usage to
be restricted to the mathematical sense. In other words, the *functional
paradigm* followers deliberately renounce the additional freedom
programming languages like Python provides in function definitions and
usages with respect to the mathematical sense. As a rule-of-thumb we can
say that deviating from the mathematical sense makes your programming
error prone.

Recursion
---------

Recursion is a function definition technique in which the definition
makes use of calls to the function being defined. Although it is
difficult to grasp, it allows compact and more readable code for
recursive algorithms, relations or mathematical functions.

It is customary to give the infamous example of the recursive definition
of factorial. First, let us put it down in mathematical terms:

.. math::


   \begin{array}{lll}
   N! & = & (N-1)!\times N, \qquad \textrm{for}\ N\in \mathbf{N}, \;\; N>0 \\
   0! & =  & 1, \nonumber
   \end{array}

Based on this, we can realize that:

-  :math:`6!` is :math:`6\times5!`
-  :math:`5!` is :math:`5\times 4!`
-  :math:`4!` is :math:`4\times 3!`
-  :math:`3!` is :math:`3\times 2!`
-  :math:`2!` is :math:`2\times 1!`
-  :math:`1!` is :math:`1\times 0!`
-  :math:`0!` is :math:`1`

Substituting any factorial value, based on this rule, one ends up with

.. math::


   6! = 6\times 5\times 4\times 3\times 2 \times 1 \times 1.

Making use of :math:`(N-1)!` while we are defining :math:`N!` is making
a recursive definition. The Python equivalent of the above given
recursive mathematical definition of the factorial would be:

.. code:: python

   def factorial(N):
       if N == 0: return 1
       else: return N * factorial(N-1)

High-level languages are designed so that each call to the ``factorial``
function does not remember any previous call(s) even if they are still
active (unfinished). For every new call, fresh positions for all local
variables are created in the memory without forgetting the former values
of variables for the unfinished calls.

From the programmers point of view, the only concern is the algorithmic
answer to the question:

   “Having the recursive call returned the correct answer to the smaller
   problem, how can I cook up the answer to the actual problem?”

It requires a kind of ‘stop thinking’ (leap of faith) action: ‘Stop
thinking how the recursive call comes up with the correct answer’. Just
concentrate on the next step paraphrased in the quotation above.

Not to get into an infinite, non-stopping recursive loop, you should be
careful about two aspects:

1. The recursive call should be made with a decrescent (getting smaller)
   argument. In the factorial example, calculation of :math:`N!`
   recursively called :math:`(N-1)!`, i.e. a smaller value than
   :math:`N!`.

2. The function definition must start with a test for the smallest
   possible argument case (in the factorial example, this was 0 (zero))
   where a value for this case is directly returned (in the factorial
   example this was 1 (one)). This is called the termination or base
   condition.

Let us consider another example: We have a list of unordered numbers.
Nothing is pre-known about the magnitude of the numbers. The problem is
to find the maximum of the numbers in that list.

Let us say you are given a list of, say, 900 numbers. For a second,
assume that you have a very loving grandpa. Your grandpa has a rule of
his own: not to corrupt you, he will not solve the problem for you but,
if you reduce the problem slightly, his heart softens and provides the
answer for the smaller problem.

Presumably, the simplest ‘reduction’ that you can do on a 900-element
list is removing an element from it and making it a list of 899 numbers.
As far as Python lists are concerned, the simplest of the simple is to
remove the first element: If ``L`` is your list, ``L[0]`` is the first
element and ``L[1:]`` is the list of remaining elements. So, the trick
is to remove the first element, take ``L[1:]`` to your grandpa (that is
making the recursive call), and ask for the solution. Your grandpa is
very cooperative and gives you the solution (the biggest number) for the
list (``L[1:]``) you passed to him.

However, we are not finished: On one hand you have what your grandpa
returned to you as the biggest number of the slightly reduced list
(``L[1:]``), and on the other hand, you have the removed (first) element
``L[0]``. Now, which one will you return as the solution of the 900
number list? Think about it!

Here is the solution in Python:

.. code:: python

    def find_max(L):
    	if len(L) == 1: return L[0]   # Terminating condition
    	else:
    		grandpa_result = find_max(L[1:])   #recursion is on L with the 0th element removed
    		if grandpa_result > L[0]: return grandpa_result
    		else: return L[0]
    
    # Let's try with a simple list -- try changing M and check the result
    M = [-100, 10, -10, 100]
    print("The maximum element of M is:", find_max(M))


.. parsed-literal::
    :class: output

    The maximum element of M is: 100


As you may have recognized, the definition started with testing for the
smallest case. That is a single element list for which the result (the
biggest number in the list) is that single number itself.

Recursion helps writing elegant functions. However, it does not come for
free. The price is in the time and memory overhead spent on creating a
new function call. Time may be something tolerable but memory is
limited. For functions that make thousands of recursive calls, you
should better seek algorithmic solutions that do not lean on recursion.
Python has a default for recursion depth, which is set to 1000. This can
be altered. As said, it is better to seek a non-recursive solution
unless you know very well of what you are doing.

Any recursive function can be implemented using iterations. The reverse
is also true: Any iterative function can be implemented using recursion.
The definition of the problem or the algorithm generally provides hints
for whether recursion or iteration is better for implementing your
solution.

Function Examples
-----------------

**Example 1: Computing average and standard-deviation**

In the previous chapter, we provided iterative definitions for
calculating the average and the standard-deviation of a list of numbers.
Let us look at these definitions again with functions. For the sake of
ease, the mathematical definitions are provided again. Moreover, we will
use this opportunity to talk more about iterations as well.

Average of a set (:math:`S`) of numbers is calculated by dividing the
sum of the values in the set by their number. So, if we have a set
:math:`S`:

.. math::


   avg(S) = \frac{1}{|S|}\sum_{x\in S} x,

which can be coded as:

.. code:: python

    def avg(S):
      sum = 0.0
      for x in S: sum += x
      return sum/len(S)
    
    S = [11, 2, 9, 6]
    print("The avg of S:", avg(S))


.. parsed-literal::
    :class: output

    The avg of S: 7.0


This is quite elegant. As you see it works at a higher abstraction
level. This can be done because the ``in`` operator comes in very handy
and when used as an iterator, it iterates over the elements of the list.

Sometimes it is more desirable to work with the indices to reach out to
each element. Remember that indexing of container elements start at
zero. So, a more index-based formulation of the same formula would be:

.. math::


   avg(S) = \frac{1}{|S|}\sum_{i=0}^{|S|-1} S_i

The following implements this definition:

::

   def avg(S):
     sum = 0.0
     for i in range(0, len(S)): sum += S[i]
     return sum/len(S)

   S = [11, 2, 9, 6]
   print("The avg of S:", avg(S))

This is almost okay but not perfect. ``len`` is a built-in function that
returns the element count of any container (string, list, tuple). As you
have observed ``len(S)`` is calculated twice. This is inefficient.
Function calls have a price, time-wise and space-wise, and therefore,
unnecessary calls should be avoided. To fix this, we change the code to
do computation once and store the result for further usages.

.. code:: python

    def avg(S):
      sum = 0.0
      length = len(S)
      for i in range(0, length): sum += S[i]
      return sum/length
    
    S = [11, 2, 9, 6]
    print("The avg of S:", avg(S))


.. parsed-literal::
    :class: output

    The avg of S: 7.0


``sum``, ``length``, ``i`` and the parameter ``S`` are all local
variables of the function ``avg``. In contrary to many other programming
languages, in Python we do not have to declare locals. They are
automatically recognized. This comes in very handy.

One point to note about the code is that the :math:`|S|-1` is missing.
It is not necessary because the ``range`` iterator excludes the end
value, as we discussed in the previous chapter.

| Now let us also introduce the code for standard deviation. First the
  mathematical definition:
| 

  .. math::


     std(S) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{|S|}\displaystyle\sum_{i=0}^{|S|-1}(S_i - avg(S))^2}

This time we bear in mind that unnecessary function calls should be
avoided:

.. code:: python

    def avg(S):
      sum = 0.0
      length = len(S)
      for i in range(0, length): sum += S[i]
      return sum/length
    
    def std(S):
      sum = 0.0
      length = len(S)
      average = avg(S)
      for i in range(0, length): sum += (S[i] - average)**2
      return (sum/length)**0.5
    
    S = [11, 2, 9, 6]
    print("The avg of S:", avg(S))
    print("The std of S:", std(S))


.. parsed-literal::
    :class: output

    The avg of S: 7.0
    The std of S: 3.391164991562634


We gave the solution in terms of explicit indexing. As given below this
particular problem can be coded without an iteration over indices. Such
problems are rare. Problems that require operations over vectors and
matrices or problems that aim optimizations usually require explicit
index iterations.

For sake of completeness we state the index-less solution of the average
and standard-deviation problem:

.. code:: python

    def avg(S):
      sum = 0.0
      length = len(S)
      for x in S: sum += x
      return sum/length
    
    def std(S):
      sum = 0.0
      length = len(S)
      average = avg(S)
      for x in S: sum += (x - average)**2
      return (sum/length)**0.5
    
    S = [11, 2, 9, 6]
    print("The avg of S:", avg(S))
    print("The std of S:", std(S))


.. parsed-literal::
    :class: output

    The avg of S: 7.0
    The std of S: 3.391164991562634


**Example 2: Computing check digit**

A Standard Definition from
`Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Check_digit>`__:

   "A *check digit* is a form of redundancy check used for error
   detection on identification numbers, such as bank account numbers,
   which are used in an application where they will at least sometimes
   be input manually. It consists of one or more digits computed by an
   algorithm from the other digits (or letters) in the sequence input.

..

   With a check digit, one can detect simple errors in the input of a
   series of characters (usually digits) such as a single mistyped digit
   or some permutations of two successive digits."

Middle East Technical University, our university, also implements a
check digit algorithm for student numbers. A student number has exactly
six digits. The algorithm to generate the checkdigit is as follows:

-  :math:`sum \leftarrow 0`

-  For each digit in the student number (the leftmost digit is the named
   as the ‘first’) that has an odd position (first, third, fifth), take
   the digit and add it to the :math:`sum`.

-  For each digit in the student number that has an even position
   (second, forth, sixth) take twice the digit. If this result of
   doubling is a two digit number, then add each of these digits to the
   :math:`sum`, otherwise add the result of the doubling (which is a
   single digit number itself) to the :math:`sum`.

-  The one digit number, which when added to the :math:`sum` results in
   a multiple of 10, is the check digit.

Take as example the student number **167912**:

.. figure:: ../figures/ch6_checksum.png
   :width: 300px

   How checksum is calculated for a student number.


The check digit of the student number **167912** is found to be **5**.
As you all well know, this is written as **167912-5**. That is called
the *student-id*.

Below you will find the code that computes the checkdigit for a student
number, given as a string. We encourage you to investigate it. A very
good technique to understand how a code progresses when it runs is to
insert print statements to points of interest. You can start by
inserting:

.. code:: python

   print(digit, sum)

right after the line of ``else:`` (left-aligned with the ``else``).

.. code:: python

    def checksum(S):
        sum = 0
        for i in range(0, len(S)):
            digit = int(S[i])
            if i%2 == 0: sum += digit
            else: sum += (9 if digit==9 else (2*digit) % 9)
        n = sum % 10
        return 0 if n == 0 else 10 - n
    
    print(checksum("167912"))


.. parsed-literal::
    :class: output

    5


A few notes about the code:

-  Remember indexing starts in Python at zero. One group of digits,
   namely (first, third, fifth) are actually at ``S[0]``, ``S[2]`` and
   ``S[4]``. Their indices are **even**. Or in mathematical terms, they
   are (modulo 2) zero.

-  Summing the digits of a number is a trick we learned in primary
   school. It is actually nothing else but a quick way to do (modulo 9).
   So, we are actually taking the (modulo 9) of the doubled digit. With
   one exception: If the digit is 9, the double is 18 where we have to
   add a 1+8=9 to the ``sum``. But ``(18 % 9)`` would give us zero (not
   9). So, here we have to insert an exception: For all digits except 9,
   we can use ``(2*digit) % 9``. For 9, we ought to add a 9 to the
   ``sum``.

-  The rule of constructing the check digit from the ``sum`` has a
   similar exception case for ``sum`` being a multiple of 10 (i.e. n
   (modulo 10) = 0). In that case we would have a checkdigit of 10
   (because 10-0 = 10) which is not a digit, but two digits. The
   designers decided to use a zero as the checkdigit for this particular
   case.

Now let us see how the checkdigit can be used to recover a missing digit
of the student id.

Let us assume you have a student ID as: **1🁢9503-7**. Now, can we
discover what the (**🁢**) digit is?

For this purpose we will write a function ``find_q_mark()`` that will
take a string as an argument, in which the missing digit is indicated by
a (``?``) (question mark). We are expecting that a call of
``find_q_mark("1?9503-7")`` will recover the missing digit and return
the demystified string: “139503-7”.

Note that the ``checksum()`` definition of above is still effective.

.. code:: python

    # places digit in the place of '?' in the string S
    def replace_q_mark(S, digit):  
        new_S =""
        for c in S: new_S += str(digit) if c=='?' else c
        return new_S
    
    # finds the value for the position with '?'
    def find_q_mark(MissingStdID):      # MissingStdID is something like "1?7912-5"
        six_digit_string = MissingStdID[:6]  # "1?7912"
        checksum_digit = int(MissingStdID[7])
        for missing_digit in range(0, 10):
            candidate = replace_q_mark(six_digit_string, missing_digit)
            if checksum(candidate) == checksum_digit: return candidate + MissingStdID[6:]
    
    print(find_q_mark("1?7912-5"))


.. parsed-literal::
    :class: output

    167912-5


A few notes about the code:

-  ``replace_q_mark()`` function is called by ``find_q_mark()``. It is
   only called once, therefore its actions could have been migrated into
   ``find_q_mark()``. Efficiency-wise there would be no change. But
   seperating it out, making it into a function and naming it
   accordingly makes the code more readable.

-  The first two lines that define ``find_q_mark()`` actions are merely
   dissecting the string into a student-id and a checkdigit part.

-  What we do in the ``for`` loop in ``find_q_mark()`` (on Lines 11-13)
   is coined in Computer Science as *brute force*. Practically, it is
   trying every possible case for being a solution. In this problem, the
   ``(?)`` mark can be any digit in the range [0,9]. The ``for`` loop
   tries each of these possibilities out until the computed checksum
   becomes the same as the checkdigit appearing in the input string.

**Example 3: Sequential Search**

Searching an item in a list or any other container is a frequently
performed operation required while solving world problems. For the sake
of simplicity, let us just focus on situations where only numbers are
involved; i.e. the searched item is a number and the list includes only
numbers. Extension to other data types is trivial.

In a search problem, we have a query item (let’s call it ``x``) and a
list of items (let’s call it ``L``). If ``x`` is a member of ``L``, then
we want the search algorithm to return ``True``, optionally by returning
its index in ``L``. If ``x`` is not a member of ``L``, we expect the
algorithm to return ``False``.

Consider the example list below:

.. math::


   \begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
           \hline 109 & -48 & 25 & 4 & -13 \\ \hline
   \end{array}

If ``x`` is 4, the search algorithm should return ``True``. If it is 5,
the answer should be ``False``.

Let us start with the simplest algorithm we can use: Sequential Search.
In sequential search, we start with the beginning of the list, go over
each item in the list and check if the query is equal to any item that
we go over. Here is the algorithm:

::

   Algorithm: Sequential Search with While Iterations
   ----------------------------
   Input: x -- the query number
          L -- the list of numbers
   Output: True (if x is in L) or False (if x is not in L)
   ----------------------------
   Step 1: Create a variable named Index with initial value 0
   Step 2: Create a variable named N with value length(L)
   Step 3: While Index < N is True, execute Steps 4 and 5:
   Step 4:    If x is equal to L[Index], then return True as the result
   Step 5:    Index = Index + 1
   Step 6: Return False as the result

Let us implement this simple algorithm in Python:

.. code:: python

    # Sequential Search with while statement
    def seq_search(x, L):
      index = 0                          # Step 1
      N = len(L)                         # Step 2
      while index < N:                   # Step 3
        if x == L[index]: return True    # Step 4
        index = index + 1                # Step 5
      return False                       # Step 6
    
    
    # Now let us test the function with examples:
    L = [109, -48, 25, 4, -13]
    x = 4
    print(f"seq_search({x}, {L}): ", seq_search(x, L))
    x = 5
    print(f"seq_search({x}, {L}): ", seq_search(x, L))
    x = 5
    L = []
    print(f"seq_search({x}, {L}): ", seq_search(x, L))


.. parsed-literal::
    :class: output

    seq_search(4, [109, -48, 25, 4, -13]):  True
    seq_search(5, [109, -48, 25, 4, -13]):  False
    seq_search(5, []):  False


That looks nice. However, we can have a more compact solution using
``for`` loops:

.. code:: python

    # Sequential Search with for statement
    def seq_search(x, L):
      for y in L:
        if x == y: return True
      return False
    
    # Now let us test the function with examples:
    L = [109, -48, 25, 4, -13]
    x = 4
    print(f"seq_search({x}, {L}): ", seq_search(x, L))
    x = 5
    print(f"seq_search({x}, {L}): ", seq_search(x, L))
    x = 5
    L = []
    print(f"seq_search({x}, {L}): ", seq_search(x, L))


.. parsed-literal::
    :class: output

    seq_search(4, [109, -48, 25, 4, -13]):  True
    seq_search(5, [109, -48, 25, 4, -13]):  False
    seq_search(5, []):  False


That’s the beauty of Python. These two are iterative solutions. Let us
have a look at a recursive solution. First, let us have a look at the
algorithm. The idea is essentially the same: We compare with the first
item and return ``True`` if they match. Otherwise, we continue our
search with the remaining items.

::

   Algorithm: Sequential Search with Recursion
   ----------------------------
   Input: x -- the query number
          L -- the list of numbers
   Output: True (if x is in L) or False (if x is not in L)
   ----------------------------
   Step 1: If L is empty, return False
   Step 2: If x is equal to the first item of L (L[0]), return True
   Step 3: Make a recursive call on L[1:N], and return its answer

And here is the implementation in Python:

.. code:: python

    # Sequential Search with recursion
    def seq_search(x, L):
      if L == []: return False      # Step 1: We have exhausted the list, x was not found
      if x == L[0]: return True     # Step 2: x was at the beginning of the list, yay!
      return seq_search(x, L[1:])   # Step 3: Search in the remaining items since x != L[0]
    
    # Now let us test the function with examples:
    L = [109, -48, 25, 4, -13]
    x = 4
    print(f"seq_search({x}, {L}): ", seq_search(x, L))
    x = 5
    print(f"seq_search({x}, {L}): ", seq_search(x, L))
    x = 5
    L = []
    print(f"seq_search({x}, {L}): ", seq_search(x, L))


.. parsed-literal::
    :class: output

    seq_search(4, [109, -48, 25, 4, -13]):  True
    seq_search(5, [109, -48, 25, 4, -13]):  False
    seq_search(5, []):  False


**Exercise**

Write down the pseudocode for the Python function ``seq_search`` with
``for`` statement.

**Exercise**

Extend the *recursive* implementation of ``seq_search`` to search for an
item ``x`` in a list ``L`` in cases where ``L`` can be nested. In other
words, the extended search algorithm shoud return ``True`` for:

``seq_search_nested(5, [10, [4, [5]], -84, [3]])``

and ``False`` for:

``seq_search_nested(8, [10, [4, [5]], -84, [3]])``

**Example 4: Binary Search**

If the list of items (numbers in our case) is not sorted, sequential
search is the only option for searching for an item. If, however, the
numbers are sorted (in an increasing or decreasing order), then we have
a much more efficient algorithm called binary search.

Assuming that ``L``, our list of numbers, is sorted in an increasing
order: In binary search, we make our first comparison with the number
that is at the center (middle) of the list. If the middle number is
equal to ``x``, then we obviously return ``True``. Otherwise, we compare
``x`` with the middle number: If ``x`` is smaller, then it has to be to
the left of the middle number – we can continue our search on the left
part of L. If, on the other hand, ``x`` is larger than the middle
number, it has to be on the right side of the middle number – we can
continue our search on the right part of L. This is illustrated in the
following figure.

.. figure:: ../figures/ch6_bin_search.png
   :width: 550px

   Binary search algorithm.


Here is the pseudocode that describes this algorithm:

::

   Algorithm: Binary Search with Recursion
   ----------------------------
   Input: x -- the query number
          L -- the list of numbers
   Output: True (if x is in L) or False (if x is not in L)
   ----------------------------
   Step 1: If length(L) is zero then return False since the list is empty
   Step 2: Create a variable Mid_index with value length(L)/2
   Step 3: If x = L[Mid_Index], return True, we found the item
   Step 4: If x < L[Mid_index] then make recursive call with L[0:Mid_index] and return its answer
   Step 5: Otherwise (x > L[Mid_index]) then make a recursive call with L[Mid_index+1:] and return its answer

The following is the implementation in Python:

.. code:: python

    # Binary search with recursion
    def bin_search(x, L):
      if len(L) == 0: return False                                # Step 1: Terminating condition
      Mid_index = len(L) // 2                                     # Step 2: Uses integer division
      if x == L[Mid_index]: return True                           # Step 3
      if x < L[Mid_index]: return bin_search(x, L[0:Mid_index])   # Step 4
      if x > L[Mid_index]: return bin_search(x, L[Mid_index+1:])  # Step 5: Can drop if statement
    
    # Now let us test the function with examples:
    L = [-48, -13, 4, 25, 109]
    x = 4
    print(f"bin_search({x}, {L}): ", bin_search(x, L))
    x = 5
    print(f"bin_search({x}, {L}): ", bin_search(x, L))
    x = 5
    L = []
    print(f"bin_search({x}, {L}): ", bin_search(x, L))


.. parsed-literal::
    :class: output

    bin_search(4, [-48, -13, 4, 25, 109]):  True
    bin_search(5, [-48, -13, 4, 25, 109]):  False
    bin_search(5, []):  False


**Exercise**

Implement binary search using while statements.

**Exercise**

Identify the complexity of sequential search and binary search in the
following cases:

-  Best case: When the item that we are making our first comparison with
   is the one we were looking for.
-  Worst case: The item we are looking for is the last item with which
   we performed the comparison.
-  Average case.

**Example 5: Sorting**

Sorting pertains to ordering a list of items (:math:`L`) so that each
item in :math:`L` satisfies the following constraint:

.. math::


   L_i < L_{i+1},

which leads to an ascending (increasing) order of items in :math:`L` and
this is called *ascending sort*. If the order of the constraint is
changed to :math:`L_i > L_{i+1}`, the outcome is a descending
(decreasing) order of items in :math:`L` and this is called *descending
sort*.

An algorithm that can perform ascending sort can easily be changed to
descending sort; therefore, we will just focus on one of them, namely,
ascending sort. Moreover, we will focus on sorting a list of numbers;
however, the same algorithms can be applied on other data types as long
as an ordering constraint (``<`` or ``>``) can be defined.

**Bubble Sort**

Let us have a look at a very simple though inefficient sorting
algorithm, called *Bubble Sort*. In Bubble Sort, we start from the
beginning of the list and check whether the constraint
:math:`L_i < L_{i+1}` is violated for an :math:`i` value. If it is, we
swap :math:`L_i` with :math:`L_{i+1}`. When we hit the end of the list,
we start from the beginning of the list again and continue checking the
constraint :math:`L_i < L_{i+1}`. Once at the end of the list, we again
go back to the beginning and continue checking the constraint for each
:math:`i`. This continues until no :math:`i` value violates the
constraint :math:`L_i < L_{i+1}`, which means that the numbers are
sorted.

Therefore, in Bubble Sort, we have two loops, one outer loop that
continues until all numbers are sorted and an inner loop that goes
through the list and checks the constraint. Here is a pseudo-code for
this:

::

   Algorithm: Bubble Sort
   ----------------------------
   Input: L -- the list of numbers (not sorted)
   Output: L -- the sorted list of numbers (ascending order)
   ----------------------------
   Step 1: Create a varible Is_sorted with value False
   Step 2: Create a variable N with value length(L)
   Step 3: Create a variable Index
   Step 4: While Is_sorted is False, repeat Steps 5-11:
   Step 5:     Set Is_sorted to True
   Step 6:     Set Index to zero
   Step 7:     While Index < (N-1), repeat Steps 8-11
   Step 8:         If L[Index] > L[Index+1], then execute Steps 9 & 10:
   Step 9:              Swap L[Index] and L[Index+1]
   Step 10:             Set Is_sorted to False
   Step 11:        Index = Index + 1
   Step 12: return L

One outer iteration of the algorithm is illustrated on a small list of
numbers below:

   One outer iteration of the Bubble Sort algorithm.


With one outer iteration, the list appears to be one step closer to a
sorted list. In the example above, the largest number has found its
correct place after one outer iteration. With a second one, the second
largest number will find its place. With a third iteration, the third
largest number will find its place etc.

And here is the implementation in Python:

.. code:: python

    # Bubble Sort
    
    def bubble_sort(L):
      Is_sorted = False                                       # Step 1
      N = len(L)                                              # Step 2
      Index = 0                                               # Step 3: Can be removed in Python
    
      while Is_sorted is False:                               # Step 4
        Is_sorted = True                                      # Step 5
        Index = 0                                             # Step 6
        while Index < (N-1):                                  # Step 7
          if L[Index] > L[Index+1]:                           # Step 8
            (L[Index], L[Index+1]) = (L[Index+1], L[Index])   # Step 9
            Is_sorted = False                                 # Step 10
          Index = Index + 1                                   # Step 11
      return L                                                # Step 12
    
    # Let us test our implementation with some sample lists
    L = [109, -13, 4, -48, 25]
    print(f"bubble_sort({L}): ", bubble_sort(L))
    
    L = [-48, -13, 4, 25, 109]
    print(f"bubble_sort({L}): ", bubble_sort(L))
    
    L = []
    print(f"bubble_sort({L}): ", bubble_sort(L))


.. parsed-literal::
    :class: output

    bubble_sort([109, -13, 4, -48, 25]):  [-48, -13, 4, 25, 109]
    bubble_sort([-48, -13, 4, 25, 109]):  [-48, -13, 4, 25, 109]
    bubble_sort([]):  []


Programming Style
-----------------

With the topics covered in this chapter, we started working with longer
and more elaborated Python codes. Up to now, we have introduced crucial
aspects that can be arranged differently among programmers:

-  Naming variables and functions.
-  Indentation.
-  Function definition.
-  Commenting.

Longing for brevity and readability, the creators of Python have defined
some guidelines of style for those interested: `Python Style
Guide <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`__.

There are alternative styles and we strongly recommend you to choose one
and stick to it as a programming style.

Important Concepts
------------------

We would like our readers to have grasped the following crucial concepts
and keywords from this chapter (all related to Python):

-  Defining functions.
-  Function parameters and how to pass values to functions.
-  Default parameters.
-  Scopes of variables.
-  Local, enclosing, global and built-in scopes.
-  Higher-order functions.
-  Differences of functions between programming and Mathematics.
-  Recursion.

Exercises
---------

-  Write a Python function named ``only_numbers()`` that removes items
   in a list that are not numbers. E.g.
   ``only_numbers([10, "ali", [20], True, 4])`` should return
   ``[10, 4]``. Implement two versions: One using iteration and another
   using recursion.

-  Write a Python function named ``flatten()`` that removes nesting in a
   nested list and lists all elements in a single non-nested list. E.g.
   ``flatten([1, [4, 5, [6]], [["test"]]])`` should return
   ``[1, 4, 5, 6, "test"]``.

-  Write a Python function named ``reverse()`` that reverses the order
   of elements in a list. E.g. ``reverse([10, 5, 0])`` should return
   ``[0, 5, 10]``. Implement two versions: One using iteration and
   another using recursion.

-  Write a Python function named ``greatest_divisor()`` that finds the
   greatest divisor of an integer. The greatest divisor of an integer
   :math:`n` is an integer :math:`x < n` that satisfies
   :math:`n = k \cdot x` for some integer :math:`k`. E.g.
   ``greatest_divisor(12)`` should return ``6``.
